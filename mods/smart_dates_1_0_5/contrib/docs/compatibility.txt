This doc is for MOD creators and peoeple, who can't get it to work with othe MODs.
I tried to keep this MOD as compatible with other MODs as possible, and that's why
you'll have pretty many edits. These edits are just minimal, so it won't make much
of a difference.

So how does this MOD work? What does it do?

It modifies phpbb's create_date() function, and adds a third (optional) parameter,
that is set to "false" by default. The reason i did this was compatibility. I could
have simply had it set to "true" and reduce the file edits to a minimum. But what if
somebody installs another MOD, that uses this function (and i bet there are tonns of em)
and it just doesn't do what it should?

Want to have exemples? A Calendar MOD will have dates in the future, no way of saying -4
days ago. My temp ban MOD would have the same problem. And i can't be bothered to create
addons for all those MODs.


So how would you add it to a MOD, that should use it? This is very simple, just find the
'create_date(' part, and add ', true' before the ')'. So then it would look something like:

$variable = create_date( $date_format, $timestamp, $timezone, true );


There's not really much more to be said. I just explained a really simple thing with way too
many words, and you probably already knew it :D
