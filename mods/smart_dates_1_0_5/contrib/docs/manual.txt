Have some docs, why not?

If you want to understand how the MOD works, have a look at compatibility.txt

Demo screenshots can be found in contrib/screenshots/

Well anyway, let's explain the features of this MOD:

1. Admin panel settings
 - a) Disable
 - b) Add time to smart dates
 - c) Edit profile
2. Users profile settings
 - a) Per-user disable
3. General
 - a) Display locations
 - b) What time is supported


1. Admin panel settings

a) Disable
The setting in the Admin panel allows you to totally disable the MOD.
You will never see any Smart dates then, even if you have it enabled
as a user. The option in editprofile will also be removed, you'll not
even see it. You will be able to change it in the ACP user management
though.

b) Add time to smart dates
With this setting enabled, the time of the day will be added to the smart
date, if the time is at least an hour ago. So this is possible:
"1 hour ago at 03:20".

c) Edit profile
You have the same option as the user in admin edit profile. How useles...

2. Users profile settings

a) Per-user disable
If a user doesn't like my MOD (i would cry), he can disable it for himself,
and he won't see any smart dates anymore.

3. General

a) Display locations
The smart dates get displayed everywhere. Anywhere you could imagine...
Nothing more to say about it, lol. If you found a place where it's missing,
please let me know.

b) What time is supported
If a date is under a minute, you will get seconds.
If it's under an hour, you'll get minutes.
If it's under a day (24h), you'll get hours.
If it's in the last 2 days, you'll get "yesterday".
If it's in the last week, you'll get days.

I hope that covers all you wanted to know.
