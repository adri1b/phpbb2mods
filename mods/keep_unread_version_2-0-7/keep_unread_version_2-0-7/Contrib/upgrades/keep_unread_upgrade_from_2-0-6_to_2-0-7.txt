##############################################################
## MOD History:
##
##   2007-07-04 - Version 2.0.7
##		- Fixed bug that sometimes resulted in a users's own posts being shown as unread after
##		  'mark all topics read' link is clicked;
##		- Fixed timing bug that sometimes caused a whole topic to be marked as read when you 
##		  reply to a post in the middle and sometimes caused problems when other people post
##		  in a topic while you were replying to a post in that topic
##
##   2006-06-20 - Version 2.0.6
##		- Fixed bug that gave error message when someone gives the wrong login info 
##		  and in certain other instances when guests are not authorized to view any forums;
##		  changed code in list_new_unreads() to make it a bit more efficient.
##
##   2006-06-09 - Version 2.0.5a
##		- Changed mod script so that it installs properly on phpbb 2.0.21 (simply deleted the two changes
##		  in search.php that disabled the usual phpbb behavior of preventing a user from searching for 
##		  an author with a wildcard and specifying less than a minimum number of characters (e.g. 3); 
##		  but note that I did not add an upgrade script from 2.0.5 to 2.0.5a because any user who had 2.0.5 
##		  installed and who successfully upgraded to phpbb 2.0.21 has already addressed these changes);
##		  for information on how to upgrade to phpbb 2.0.21 if you have this mod installed, 
##		  see: http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?p=2173137#2173137
##
##   2006-06-01 - Version 2.0.5
##		- Optimized the query in the list_new_unreads function (thanks for the idea, bigwebmaster); and 
##		  changed the code so that list_new_unreads only gets run a single time when the user is on index.php
##		  (before this change, index.php ran list_new_unreads a first time and page_header.php ran it a second time)
##		- Put in code that will allow people to easily add a toggling link ("View your unread posts" versus 
##		  "You have no unread posts") on pages other than index.php (see author's notes for how to add links)
##		- Changed viewtopic.php so that the mod will work regardless of whether viewtopic is set
##		  to display from oldest to newest or newest to oldest
##
##   2006-05-20 - Version 2.0.4
##		- Changes to conform to phpbb2.0.20 changes (only relevant for the mod itself, 
##		  not the upgrade...but if you already have keep unread installed and
##		  are trying to upgrade phpbb from 2.0.19 to 2.0.20 and are stuck because of 
##		  this mod, see http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?p=2082858#2082858 for help)
##		- Fixed bugs that would trigger an error for banned users and that would show 
##		  guests that there are unread posts in forums they are not authorized as guests
##		  to view on boards with mod to the mod to change view unread posts link installed
##		- Optimized the queries for the mod to the mod to change view unread 
##		  posts link so that the code runs fewer queries to get to the same result
##		- Changed basic mod so that the link will now read "View unread posts" if there 
##		  are any and "You have no unread posts" if there aren't any
##		- Changed index_body.tpl to ensure that users would see the mark all forums read 
##		  link even if they are not logged in.
##		- Changed the author's notes to include links to posts showing how
##		  to make this mod compatible with the simple subforums mod, 
##		  the old version of categories hierarchy mod,
##		  the latest topics on index mod and the post sort order mod
##		- Changed author's notes to show how to add the number of topics with unread posts 
##		  to the link, and how to add a link to the page that shows a list of unread posts 
##		  that lets the user mark all posts read
##		- Changed the author's note about adding a text link for marking a post unread so that 
##		  the link appears on the far right in the same font as the 'Back to Top' link that
##		  appears on the far left
##
##   2006-01-01 - Version 2.0.3c
##		- No changes at all in the code.  Repacked to show so that the 'changed files' version in
##		  the contrib folder has phpbb2.0.19 version of those file
##
##   2005-11-20 - Version 2.0.3b
##		- Changes requried for validation (no functional changes)
##
##   2005-10-18 - Version 2.0.3 or 2.0.3a
##		- Added author's notes telling people who use topic calendar mod, PCP or other mods that install
##		  functions_topic_list.php in the 'includes' directory to look at Niksa's
##		  post describing how to adapt the mod to work with those mods;
##		- Fixed bug that would improperly treat 'mark all topics read' request when the user was on the board as a guest;
##		- security change to prevent possible sql injection risk;
##		- Changed mod to the mod so that it checks which forums a user is authorized to view when it figures out
##		  when to turn on the big red "View new posts" link
##
##   2005-07-21 - Version 2.0.2a
##		- No change in mod (you don't need to upgrade from 2.0.2 to this)...just a change in a FIND command in the mod script
##		  to dovetail with a change made from phpbb2.0.16 to 2.0.17
##
##   2005-07-12 - Version 2.0.2
##		- Small changes required for validation; no change in functionality
##
##   2005-07-05 - Version 2.0.1
##		- Small bugfix to correct intermittant error in topic_last_read function when marking topics read
##
##   2005-05-27 - Version 2.0.0
##		- Merlin Sythove updates as specified above.
