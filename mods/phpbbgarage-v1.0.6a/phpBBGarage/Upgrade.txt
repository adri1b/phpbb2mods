Each upgrade must be complete in sequence .i.e 1.0.0 -> 1.0.2 -> 1.0.3 -> 1.0.4 -> 1.0.5 -> 1.0.6

NOTE: There was no 1.0.1

So if the current version is 1.0.3 and you are running 1.0.0 you will first need to complete the 1.0.2 upgrade.

To complete a version upgrade you need to process the upgrade_garage.txt file and then run the upgrade_garage.php file. 
Each of these files will have a version number showing which version it is the upgrade for.

This files can be found in the upgrade folder.
