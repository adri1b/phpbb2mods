Security_question.mod

This mod asks a question that needs some rational thought put in to the answer, thus stopping a spambot. In addition it hides the Profile Information fields during registration. So a human spammer who never intends to confirm his membership can not leave a spam URL in any of the fields. Also, a wrong answer re directs you to the index page.

The question and answer are configerable in the ACP to any you choose, including a text answer. The answer is now CasE inSensiTIve.

If you have already added a MOD to your forum that alters the Users Profile Information, then use the MOD in the contrib folder, which has had the 'Hide Profile Information' removed.
