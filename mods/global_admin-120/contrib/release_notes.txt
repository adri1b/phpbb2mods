Version 1.2.0 - July 23, 2006
General update to confirm that the modification still works correctly on newer
phpBBs, and a repacking for submission to the database at phpBB.com.  The admin
template files are moved to a new location in this version, which has some
benefits.
Added upgrade instructions.
Removed the old Categories Hierarchy additional changes, replacing them with a
full alternate install that is more current.


Version 1.0.1 - August 04, 2005 6:02 PM Eastern Time
This is mostly a maintenance release. In using this, I noticed it was
filling up my error logs when trying to find background images in admin.css, so
I added code to remove those. The documentation as a few updates, including the
addition of notes about using this hack alongside the eXtreme Styles and
Statistics hacks.  Also added premodded files.


Version 1.0.0 - Feb 7, 2004 12:00 pm Eastern Time
This is the first official release of this hack, but I've had it sitting in the
back of my mind (and hard drive ;)) for months.  I've tested it with subSilver,
but the basic concepts should would with any template.
