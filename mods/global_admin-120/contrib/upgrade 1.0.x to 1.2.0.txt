--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following are instructions from upgrading your install of Global Admin
Template 1.0.x to Global Admin Template 1.2.0.

If you are working with Global Admin Template for Categories Hierarchy, please
note that upgrading is not supported.  Do a complete uninstall of the old
version and then do a fresh install of Global Admin Template for Categories
Hierarchy.

1) Uninstall the 1.0.x changes to admin/admin_styles.php and
   includes/functions.php.  For details, see the uninstall instructions included
   in Global Admin Template 1.0.x.
   If you installed the eXtreme Styles Fix in a previous version, uninstall that
   also. It isn't needed once you upgrade.

2) Install the new changes to includes/functions.php as listed in the Global
   Admin Template 1.2.0 file_edits.txt.

3) Create an admin/templates/admin/ directory on the forum.

4) Move all the files in your templates/admin/ directory to the new directory,
   admin/templates/admin/.  When finished, delete the templates/admin/
   directory.

5) Move the following files from their current location in your forum (on the
   left) to the new location (on the right).
		templates/error_body.tpl   to admin/templates/error_body.tpl
