Version 1.2.0
-Relocated the admin tpls from templates/admin/ to admin/templates/admin/.
   -This makes the old edits to admin_styles.php unnecessary, so those are
    removed.
   -The old conflicts between this mod and eXtreme Styles are solved by this,
    so no extra fixes are needed for that now.
-Regarding the extra code changes from the previous version:
   -Moved to contrib/fixes/
   -Removed the Categories Hierarchy file.
   -The eXtreme Styles fix isn't needed any more, but is still included.
-Dropped the premodded files. I don't feel they're necessary now.
-Added upgrade instructions.
-Added separate install instructions for Categories Hierarchy.
-Various documentation updates.
