This MOD is written primarily using MODX. As of writing easyMOD does not
support this format. A version in the older text format has been included in
the '/contrib' directory for use with easyMOD.

Note:
The instructions may appear in a different order (i.e. after-add before the
in-line actions instead of before) in the MODX version, this is still valid as
the same search seed is referenced. In MODX all top level edits are performed
before in-line edits.
