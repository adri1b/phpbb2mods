                                  INTRODUCTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some forums have problems with new users constantly posting topics similar to
others that already exist on the forum.  This could be prevented if the new
users used the forum's search engine before posting, but most of them won't.
Maybe they don't know how, don't think to search, or whatever.

To help these users and lessen your moderation tasks, Subject Check can
perform a search when someone attempts to post a new topic.  The search will
look for other topics containing the words in the new topic's subject.  If 
similar topics are found, the user is prompted to look at these and post in one
if their message fits there.

                                    FEATURES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Checks titles of new topics to see if a topic with a similar title already
 exists. If similar topics are found, a message recommends that the poster add their message to one of them instead of posting a new topic.
-The message can still be posted as a new topic, in case none of the similar
 topics are a close fit. A "Strict Mode," to prevent the posting of the new
 topic, is included.
-Can be turned on and off for each forum.
-Can be restricted to members with low post counts.
-Options to turn subject checking off for moderators and administrators.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.0.1 - July 27, 2007
A couple of minor changes to pass validation at phpbb.com.  If you're updating
from a previous install, just reupload subject_check.php.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                 INCLUDED FILES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the ZIP file for this download is unpacked, the following new directories
may be created on your system, each containing the noted files.
	contrib   - Important documents regarding usage of the download. READ THEM.
	root      - New files that will be added to your forum, if any.
The "root" directory may not be present - this usually means that the
modification does not add new files to your forum.
Alongside these directories, you should see a install.txt file.  This has the
install instructions.

The "contrib" directory may contain the following files:
	license.txt       - License information regarding this download.
	release_notes.txt - Short summary of changes in each version.
	changelog.txt     - Detailed list of changes to each version.
	uninstall.txt     - Instructions for uninstalling.
	upgrades/*.txt    - Instructions for upgrading from a previous version.

phpBB Smith is my personal phpBB related web site and therefore tends to have
most of my works (including older versions if needed), while the other sites
generally have some, but not all, of my stuff around somewhere.  Basically, they
all have different things, so check them all.  If you need to e-mail me, I can
be reached via a contact form at the phpBB Smith site.

Have a nice day. :D
