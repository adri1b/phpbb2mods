## MOD Title:          Resize Posted Images Based on Max Width
## MOD Author:         spooky2280 < webmaster@christianfecteau.com > (Christian Fecteau) http://portfolio.christianfecteau.com/
## MOD Description:    This MOD resizes images within posts to make it so they don't break your layout. Images resized are made 
##                     clickable and openable in a popup in full-size. You can specify a different max width for each of your themes.
##                     Images that do not exceed the max width are left as is. See the MOD in action: http://christianfecteau.com/rmw

## Author Notes:
##
## This MOD uses Javascript and works in all W3C DOM browsers:
## NN6+, IE5+, Mozilla/Firefox/Camino, Safari, Opera7+, etc.
##
## To set a different max width than the 400 pixels default one:
##    1. OPEN overall_header.tpl and simple_header.tpl in templates/subSilver/
##    2. FIND rmw_max_width = 400
##    3. CHANGE 400 to the width in pixels that you want for this template
##    4. REPEAT steps 1 to 3 for each of your other templates (if any)
##
## Don't forget to edit all your templates and languages in addition to subSilver and lang_english

## MOD History:
##
##   2005-01-18 - Version 2.4.5
##      - Files with changes from 2.4.4 to 2.4.5:
##               - templates/rmw_jslib.js
##      - I forgot to remove a line (124) in the js file that was there for testing purposes only:
##        rmw_obj.setAttribute('resizemod','over');
##        This can cause a bug if for some reason the onload event fires twice. A user reported
##        a situation where it happens and I was able to force the bug, so... line's deleted now!
##
##   2005-01-17 - Version 2.4.4
##      - Files with changes from 2.4.3 to 2.4.4:
##               - templates/rmw_jslib.js
##      - The maximized feature for the popup introduced in 2.4.3 was causing
##        permission problem. If the popup stayed opened while the location of
##        the opener changed or only refreshed, the opener was losing access 
##        permission to the popup. To fix it, the popup is now closed onunload
##        of the opener.
##
##   2005-01-13 - Version 2.4.3
##      - Files with changes from 2.4.2 to 2.4.3:
##               - templates/rmw_jslib.js
##      - Now the popup window is maximized automatically, except in Opera
##      - Added a MOD file for the "File Attachment" MOD
##
##   2005-01-01 - Version 2.4.2
##      - Files with changes from 2.4.1 to 2.4.2:
##               - templates/rmw_jslib.js
##      - A bug with IE and only with my machine is fixed. Nobody reported it, but
##        whatever, I fixed it on my machine. :-) You can read about it at:
##        http://www.christianfecteau.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=23
##      - Changed the FIND for overall_header.tpl because the previous one would have failed
##        with EasyMod and the Subza theme.
##      - The popup is now larger. Its width and height are relative to screen resolution
##      - Added a link to the demo in the MOD Description.
##
##   2004-12-14 - Version 2.4.1
##      - Files with changes from 2.4.0 to 2.4.1:
##               - templates/subSilver/overall_header.tpl
##               - templates/subSilver/simple_header.tpl
##               - templates/rmw_jslib.js
##      - Fixed a bug related to node cloning and multiple firing of the
##        same onload event. Upgrade to 2.4.1 is strongly recommended.
##      - As a result of this bug being fixed, newer Geckos (Firefox, NN7.1, etc.) can
##        now run the MOD flawlessly with the same dynamic method used with IE5+ Windows.
##      - Script performance improved, with even less CPU usage.
##
##   2004-11-28 - Version 2.4.0
##      - Went back to waiting for the width in all browsers except IE5+ Windows
##        which is the only browser that passed all my intensive tests. All the
##        other browsers have a bug of some sort with the method of resizing before
##        knowing the width, even Firefox. They are not serious bugs, but that was
##        enough to make me drop the dynamic method I'm using flawlessly with IE5+.
##      - Now (for IE5+ Windows) images downloading are represented as little
##        {T_BODY_TEXT} border color squares until they're downloaded. The
##        reason for this is that I'm resizing all images before knowing their
##        width (either they're too large or not). And if they're not too large,
##        I'm resizing to their real width onload of each image. But if someone
##        posts a broken link for an image, the onload event will never fire and
##        the image will remain the size I made it before knowing its width. So
##        if someone posts a bunch of non-exisiting images on the same line and
##        if I'm resizing them to the max width allowed before knowing that they
##        don't even exist, then the onload event for these non-existing images
##        will never fire and the screen width will be huge. Si I'm resizing every
##        image to the width of the square for broken images: 28 pixels. And onload
##        of the real images, pop!!! they're resized to their real width or to the
##        max allowed width if their real width is higher. And the broken images
##        stay at 28 pixels wide.
##      - I've put the Javascript in an external file and left only the strict minimum
##        in the templates, to save bandwidth.
##      - Changed the value of the timer to 2 seconds. Less CPU usage.
##      - Tweaked a few other things to make the script faster.
##
##   2004-11-25 - Version 2.3.0 (beta)
##      - Added a <div style="display:none" id="resizemod"></div> right before
##        the closing body tag so the script knows the exact moment when to stop
##        scanning for images.
##      - Changed the value of the timer from 1 milisecond to 1 second: Less CPU
##        usage and the difference is negligible. Seeing an horizontal scrollar
##        during 1 second is not the end of the world.
##      - For Opera, I've gone back to the method of waiting to know the width
##        and resizing only the images that need to. Opera was failing to resize
##        down images with a width samller than the max width.
##      - Now the border is drawn around the image before it is loaded so users
##        know that an image is coming into that blank space.
##
##   2004-11-24 - Version 2.2.0 (beta)
##      - Another major improvement: now images are scaled whether their width is
##        known or not. So there is definitely no horizontal scrollbar at all.
##        It still works in all W3C DOM browsers but I think IE is way better
##        than the other browsers for this MOD. Now large images are made clickable
##        only once they're loaded. It was useless to make them clickable before
##        completion of download. Thanks to Avochelm for the idea of resizing
##        before the width is known. It was a real puzzle to make it work though!
##
##   2004-11-23 - Version 2.0.0 (beta)
##      - Major change: Images are scaled down right as the page is displayed,
##        and huge images are now downloaded slowly in their tiny container
##        while users browse the forum with its regular layout width. The browser
##        needs to connect to servers for getting images' width, so after a certain
##        time, if the connection is still not made, the script terminates. Then
##        onload of the image a different function is called to resize it if the
##        previous function failed to do it at runtime.
##      - Images resized get a 2px dotted {T_BODY_LINK} color
##      - Dropped 'longdesc' for a made-up attribute: 'resizemod'. 'longdesc' was
##        too buggy cause browsers handle it like a URI.
##      - MOD syntax improved for EasyMod
##      - Looking for <!-- END switch_enable_pm_popup --> in overall_header.tpl
##        instead of </head> because some styles (like Chairs) don't have a
##        closing HEAD tag.
##
##   2004-11-20 - Version 1.1.0
##      - Added comments in the code to identify the MOD
##      - Made use of $lang var so that it will work with multiple languages
##      - Tested with EasyMod v0.1.13 and phpBB 2.0.11
##
##   2004-11-13 - Version 1.0.1
##      - Changed variables' names:
##        They were too common and could have conflicted with other scripts.
##      - Removed slashes from comments to avoid possible bug with /*/
##
##   2004-11-12 - Version 1.0.0
##      - initial release phpBB2 ver 2.0.10
