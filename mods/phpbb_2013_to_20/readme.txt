The files you now have in front of you are the code changes from phpBB 2.0.13 to 2.0.14 in three different formats.
Feel free to add the archive to your homepage, feel free to post the bbcode format at your forum.

There is one file you need to remove from your webspace to be fully up-to-date (this file is causing a full path disclosure).
So, please remove/delete the db/oracle.php file from your webspace.
