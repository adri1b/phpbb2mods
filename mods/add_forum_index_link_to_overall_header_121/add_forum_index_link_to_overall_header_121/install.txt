## Author Notes:
##
## This MOD adds a link to the forum index in the header. This is especially
## helpful on boards with a portal installed, as most portals change the
## main image that usually links to index.php to link to the portal.
##
## UPGRADES:
## If you are upgrading from an earlier version of Add Forum Link to Overall
## Header, please see the upgrades/ folder. View the readme.txt file to find
## out which file to use.
##
## STYLES COMPATIBILITY:
## Due to the variants used in different styles, the In-Line Before, Add
## action used in templates/subSilver/overall_header.tpl may not work
## correctly. This line has been written to accomadate the subSilver style
## and other styles based on the subSilver template.
## HOW TO OVERCOME:
## Please, feel free to edit this line so that it follows the example of
## other lines in this section. IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE, please request support
## on this MOD's phpBB.com support topic.
##
## EASYMOD COMPATIBILITY:
## If you do not have any other styles besides subSilver, feel free
## to use Nuttzy's EasyMOD to install. If you have other styles,
## you should install by hand, even if you know that they are based
## on the subSilver template, just to be safe. EasyMOD can be downloaded
## at < http://area51.phpbb.com/phpBB22/viewtopic.php?sid=&f=17&t=15391 >.
##
## MOD IMCOMPATIBILITY:
## Some other MODs may also add links to the header, therefore changing
## the position of this link. You can feel free to move the entire line
## in the In-Line Before, Add used in templates/subSilver/overall_header.tpl
## to a more suitable location. Be sure that you move it to the MIDDLE of two &nbsp;
## commands to make sure that the link fits correctly.
## In the contrib/ directory is provided some adaptations of this MOD for other
## existing MODs, see contrib/readme.txt for more details.

AUTHOR'S NOTE:
These lines of code determine what will appear as part of the Forum Index link. The first line tells phpBB what text to display as part of the link, and the second line tells what to display in the tooltip, which is the text that appears when the mouse is hovered over the link.
You can feel free to edit these to your liking. To edit the text that displays the link, replace forum index in the first line with whatever you want. To edit the tooltip, replace Go to the Forum Index. in the second line with whatever you want.
Note that we are in a PHP file, so replace all instances of ' with \' and all instances of \ with \\ so that you do not mess up the file.
