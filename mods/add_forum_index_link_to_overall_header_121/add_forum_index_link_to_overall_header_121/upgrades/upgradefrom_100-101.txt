AUTHOR'S NOTE:
These lines of code determine what will appear as part of the Forum Index link. The first line tells phpBB what text to display as part of the link, and the second line tells what to display in the tooltip, which is the text that appears when the mouse is hovered over the link.
You can feel free to edit these to your liking. To edit the text that displays the link, replace forum index in the first line with whatever you want. To edit the tooltip, replace Go to the Forum Index. in the second line with whatever you want.
Note that we are in a PHP file, so replace all instances of ' with \' and all instances of \ with \\ so that you do not mess up the file.
