## Author Notes:
##
## This MOD adds a link to the forum index in the header. This is especially
## helpful on boards with a portal installed, as most portals change the
## main image that usually links to index.php to link to the portal.
## The adaptation is specialized for an installation on boards that have
## Ptirhiik's Qbar/Qmenu MOD installed.
##
## STYLES COMPATIBILITY:
## This adaptation should not have any problems with other styles.
##
## EASYMOD COMPATIBILITY:
## This adaptation CANNOT be installed with EasyMOD, as the adaptation does
## not edit any files. Instead, you need to follow the directions below.
##
## MOD IMCOMPATIBILITY:
