## Author Notes: 
##
##	- The original author (until 1.0.0) was GUI < spam@nickm.org > (Nick Muerdter). 
##	  After that version, he gave me (chatasos) the permission to continue with his mod.
##	  This is almost a completely new mod based on GUI's original idea.
##
##	- If you want to upgrade from GUI's version to this one, just follow the instructions for installing.
##	  Upgrading or installing from scratch requires exactly the same steps.
##
##	- When upgrading from versions 2.1.x to 2.2.0 or later, you have to run the db command 
##	  "DROP table `phpbb_search_rebuild`" before proceeding with the install,
##	  because the mod's table has changed its structure.
##
##	- When upgrading from version 2.2.0 to a later version, you just have to copy (overwrite) 
##	  all the files to their appropriate directory. No changes have been made in the DB.
##
##	- You must have javascript enabled in your browser in order to have the script work flawlessly.
##	  It may seem to work fine with javascript disabled, but you'll loose a lot of its functionality.
##
##	- The automatic progress of the mod depends on the META tag "refresh" being allowed in your browser.
##	  Some browsers (Opera) give you the option of disabling it, so please keep this in mind.
##
##	- When running the mod it's better to have your forum disabled, because db usage is getting very high.
##	  Mod under normal circumstances doesn't have any problems when some posts are deleted/inserted while
##	  processing is on, since it automatically recalculates its parameters. But to be on the safe side,
##	  try to have your board disabled while processing.
##
##	- There might be some problems when calculating the db sizes on non-MySQL databases, 
##	  so please if you find any, inform the relevant topic on the phpBB site.
##
##	- jelv1 (John Elvin) has reported a bug on phpbb's synonym handling routine (in 2.0.19) which you can find
##	  here : http://www.phpbb.com/bugs/viewreport.php?b=824.
##	  Maybe you want to implement first John's fix and afterwards run this mod.
##
##	- The mod takes only 4-5 minutes to install, but you'd better read the following instructions 
##	  if you don't know what to do after installing.
##
##
##	Instructions (quite detailed)
##	-----------------------------
##	This mod will index every post in your forum, rebuilding the search tables. 
##
##	This is useful when :
##
##	- You have imported posts from another forum 
##	- You have lost/deleted/corrupted your phpbb search tables in one way or another
##	- You want to transfer your db to another server (you can skip the copying of search tables 
##	  which are usually quite a lot of MB and create them on the new server from scratch)
##	- You have updated the "search_stopwords.txt" file (running the mod will remove these words from the search tables)
##	- Users cannot find what they are searching for in your forum (although there could many other reasons for this)
##
##	You can stop whenever you like and the next time you run it again, you'll have the option of 
##	continuing from where you left off.
##	
##	It may take a long time to show its progress (depending on "Posts per cycle" and "Time limit"), 
##	so please do not move from its progress page until it is complete, unless of course you want to interrupt it. 
##
##
##	phpBB search operation (not fully verified)
##	----------------------
##	The search function of phpBB uses 3 tables:
##
##	- search_wordlist (this contains a unique entry for each word that has been posted in the forum)
##	- search_wordmatch (this contains pairs of data of which posts include which words from the search_wordlist)
##	- search_results (this contains the last searches the users executed)
##
##	phpBB marks heavily used words by changing the "word_common" field in the search_wordlist from 0 to 1 and then
##	deleting them from the search_wordmatch table.
##	Heavily used words are those who appear in the search_wordmatch table more than (4/10 * total_posts) times.
##	phpBB doesn't check for common words before adding them into the tables. It justs adds them first
##	and then deletes them if they are found to be common. 
##
##	Also phpBB uses a blacklist of words (a text file containing one word per line) that you don't want to be indexed. 
##	If you are using the default english language, this file is "language/lang_english/search_stopwords.txt".
##
##	If you want to find your most commonly used words, so you can put some of them into this blacklist,
##	you can run the following db query in phpmyadmin, before running this mod :
##
##	SELECT swl.word_id, swl.word_text, COUNT(swm.word_id) as total
##	FROM `phpbb_search_wordlist` swl, `phpbb_search_wordmatch` swm
##	WHERE swl.word_id = swm.word_id 
##	GROUP BY swm.word_id 
##	ORDER BY total 
##	DESC LIMIT 0,50 
##
##	Also, you may want to check for inconsistencies in the phpbb post tables using the following 2 sql queries:
##
##	SELECT p.*
##	FROM phpbb_posts p 
##	LEFT JOIN phpbb_posts_text pt ON p.post_id = pt.post_id
##	WHERE pt.post_id IS NULL;
##
##	SELECT pt.*
##	FROM phpbb_posts_text pt 
##	LEFT JOIN phpbb_posts p ON p.post_id = pt.post_id
##	WHERE p.post_id IS NULL;
##
##	If you get any output from the above 2 queries, it means you have some records in one table but not their
##	pair record on the other table. So it should be better to fix them before running this mod. 
##
##
##	Main page
##	---------
##	You can find the mod under the Admin CP -> General Admin -> Rebuild Search. 
##	When you run the mod, you can change the following parameters:
##
##	1) Starting post_id
##	You can choose from which post to start processing, according to some conditions:
##
##	a) Start from post_id 0, which means from the 1st post of your forum
##	b) Start from the post_id which you stopped the last time you ran the mod
##
##	- If you haven't run the mod at all, then you can only start from the beginning.
##	- If you have run the mod, but there have been new posts after that, then you can start from the beginning 
##	  (so process all posts), or continue from the post you last processed (so process only the new posts).
##	- If you have run the mod, but aborted/stopped during its operation, then you can start from the beginning 
##	  (so process all posts), or continue from the post you last aborted/stopped (so process only the remaining posts).
##
##	According to your choice on this option, some other values (No of posts, Posts per cycle) are changed automatically
##	to help you.
##
##	If you are getting strange post numbers while processing, you can try to start from the beginning, hoping 
##	they'll be corrected.
##
##	The post_id doesn't refer to the a/a number of a post while counting posts.
##	When you have 5 sequencial posts, their a/a numbers are 1,2,3,4,5 but their post_ids can be 2,7,10,23,56.
##
##	Note : At this time you cannot change this value by hand. This is something that might change in the future, 
##	although i can't find any real reason for implementing such a feature.
##
##	2) Clear search tables
##	When you start from the beginning (post_id 0) you have the option of clearing the forum search tables.
##	In all the other cases, clearing of search tables is disabled and should not be used. 
##
##	You have 3 options here :
##
##	NO: do not clear the search tables
##	DELETE: all records from the 3 phpbb search tables are deleted (slower, safer, working on all databases)
##	TRUNCATE: all 3 phpbb search tables are truncated (faster, riskier, possibly working on all databases)
##
##	You should choose TRUNCATE, if you also want to zero the auto_increment values of the search tables.
##
##	When clearing is enabled, phpbb search tables are cleared (initialized) before starting the processing.
##	Regardless of whether clearing is enabled or disabled, post processing always includes removal and insertion of posts.
##	This is so, because if you try to insert a post without removing it first, you might come up with "double" records 
##	in phpbb search tables because at the same time someone else in the forum could be editing that post.
##	Of course you can use Fast mode (see below for restrictions) if you want to bypass the removal of posts.
##
##	3) No of posts
##	You can choose how many posts to process totally. This value is automatically filled with the total 
##	posts in your forum (when you haven't processed any posts, or you have processed all posts), 
##	or with the remaining posts (when you have stopped the processing at a previous time). 
##
##	Of course you can put your own value here.
##
##	4) Posts per cycle
##	You can choose how many posts to process per cycle. The word "cycle" refers to the amount of posts 
##	belonging to the same "group" which is processed one at a time (it's like a batch of posts).
##	So, if you choose to process 200 posts totally, at 20 posts per cycle, you'll spend 200/20=10 cycles 
##	in order to complete the whole processing. 
##
##	If you are getting timeouts while processing, you should try lowering this value (see also the Time limit option).
##	Also small numbers (20-50) will help you watch much easier the progress.
##
##	Normally the mod calculates processing times per post and "adjusts" (decreases) this value automatically,
##	so it shouldn't timeout whatever value you use here. But always there can be exceptions, 
##	especially when a large post follows many short ones.
##
##	Of course if you think you have a fast server/db setup you can always risk increasing it.
##
##	6) Time limit
##	You can choose the maximum time in seconds the mod is allowed to run before it moves to the next processing cycle.
##	The mod is using as default the value of 300 secs, which is usually found on many webservers.
##
##	If you are getting timeouts while processing, you should try decreasing it (see also the Posts per cycle option).
##
##	If you're using Mozilla, mod will probably be able to get the webserver's timeout and inform you about this,
##	so you'd better keep your value below this. IE doesn't support this feature.
##
##	Also older IE versions are known to have problems with large waiting times, so you'd better try an alternative 
##	browser like Mozilla.
##
##	If your php is running in safe mode, mod will inform you of php's timeout, so you'd better keep your
##	value below this number too.
##
##	5) Refresh rate
##	You can choose how much time to wait after a cycle has finished and until the next one begins. 
##	This is called the refresh time and it's time that actually nothing happens. 
##	You can always press the "Next" button, if you don't want to wait until the timer expires, 
##	but you cannot press it while processing is on (the button displays "Processing..." during that time), 
##	because you are in the risk of bypassing some posts while processing and messing with the db.
##
##	Note : This feature might seem quite helpful when "debugging" mod's usage: you can put a low number 
##	of posts per cycle and a high refresh rate, so you can watch the progress screen as it changes 
##	and take screenshots easily.
##
##	6) Disable board
##	You can disable your board while processing, so online users won't mess with the db. Normally there should be
##	no problem if you leave it enabled, since the mod is acting like "editing" posts when processing them
##	and as you know whoever gets there last is the one who wins. The main reason why you'd want to disable it,
##	is if you have many users online and the db usage gets high; that way you can prevent the forum from becoming sluggish.
##
##	Keep in mind that if the rebuilding process times out and you have choosen to disable your board,
##	you'll probably end up with a disabled board. That means you'll have to enable it manually from your admin config.
##
##	If the rebuilding process finishes ok or is aborted by the user and you have choosen to disable your board,
##	then the board will be automatically enabled afterwards.
##
##	If your board is already disabled though the admin configuration (before running this mod), you can't change this option.
##
##	7) Fast mode
##	This mod makes the rebuilding run a little bit faster, since it bypasses the word/post removing process.
##	When you enable this option, you have to start from the beginning the rebuilding and the following default values 
##	are set automatically (you can't change most of them):
##
##	Starting post_id is set to 0
##	Clear search table method is set to TRUNCATE
##	The posts per cycle is set to 20 posts
##	The time limit is set to 60 secs
##	The refresh rate is set to 0 secs (no waiting)
##	Board is automatically disabled
##
##	Use this option only when you want to process the whole board from the beginning to the end 
##	and you don't mind keeping it disabled while the rebuilding is running. 
##	I guess it's mostly recommended for small or inactive/backup boards.
##
##
##	Progress Screen
##	-------------------
##	When you press the "Rebuild Search" button, the button label changes to "Processing..." and becomes disabled
##	until the first group of posts has been processed (or time limit has expired). 
##	After that, a progress screen appears which displays various information about the posts already 
##	processed and the ones that follow, like processing time details and database size details. 
##	Also the percentage of completed posts (session/total) is displayed in both numerical and graphical format.
##
##	When you see the message "Timer expired at x secs", it means that the mod couldn't process all the posts you told it to
##	and moved to the next cycle before the timer you have defined expires. Everything is continuing to work
##	fine, so there is no real need to worry, but you may want to lower the "Posts per cycle" value in order to
##	avoid such timeouts.
##
##	When you see the message "x posts deleted while procesessing", it means that some of the posts that were supposed
##	to be processed, were deleted by someone on your forum during the processing. Normally this shouldn't be a problem.
##
##	In order for the mod to move to the next processing cycle, one of the following conditions must be met:
##
##	a) All "Posts per cycle" have been processed
##	b) "Time limit" has expired
##
##	As noted on the bottom of the screen, all estimated values are calculated approximately 
##	based on current percent of completion. I know this might not be the best way to do it, 
##	but it works quite well as the percent increases and it provides some interesting infos.
##
##
##	Operation aborting
##	------------------
##	The "Cancel" button at the bottom allows you to interrupt the processing of posts at your will. 
##
##	If you press it while processing is on (left button says "Processing..." during that time), the group of posts 
##	that was being processed at that time will continue to be processed, although you may think that the script has stopped.
##	This is the default php/apache behaviour and i don't think i can do much about it.
##
##	If you press it while the refresh timer is shown (left button says "Next" during that time), the processing of the last
##	group of posts will have finished, so the script has finished too.
##
##	Also, if you have pressed it during processing, then please take note of the following:
##
##	When you return to the main page, if you see a message "please wait..." at the bottom, this means that probably the
##	processing of the last cycle hasn't finished yet and you'll have to wait a little more. So keep refreshing this page until
##	the message disappears (you'll see that the starting post_id has changed when it finishes).
##	Of course you can continue if you like without waiting, but keep in mind that you'll be beginning a new processing session
##	while the previous hasn't finished yet, whatever that means for your database.
##
##
##	NOTE : This mod indexes your posts (by rebuilding the search tables) exactly the same way phpbb does on each post
##	when it's written. So if afterwards you cannot find some words of a specific post that has been indexed, 
##	try to edit that post using phpbb and check again if you can find them. If you cannot find them, 
##	then search for these words isn't "working" on your forum (there could be various reasons for this).
##
##	So, if you can't find a keyword, which you're sure it exists in your posts, then please make sure that:
##
##	1) It's not included in your "language/lang_xxx/search_stopwords.txt" file.
##	    The words included in this file, are not indexed in the search tables.
##	2) It hasn't been flagged as too common in the db. You can run the following query in order to check that:
##
##		SELECT *
##		FROM `phpbb_search_wordlist`
##		WHERE `word_common` != 0
##
##	  This will show you all the words that have been flagged as too common in the phpbb db, 
##	  which means that they are not indexed in the search tables.
