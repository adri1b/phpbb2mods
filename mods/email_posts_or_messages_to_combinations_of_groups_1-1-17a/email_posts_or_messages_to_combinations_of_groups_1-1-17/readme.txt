Readme file for email posts or messages to combinations of groupsThe files you need for the basic mod are all in the root of the zip file where you will find this readme.I have put in a 'contrib' folder some alternative files you mayuse if you are running skinmaster's forum watch mod or David Hermann's forum notification mod.I have also included in the contrib folder upgrade mods for people that already have earlier versions of thismod installed and want to upgrade to the current version. Note that each upgrade mod will only upgrade you to the nextversion so you need to apply them one at a time in order from whatever version you started with until you get tothe current version.Here's additional information about what files are what in this mod...1. Most people will end up using only the following four files:	email_posts_or_messages_to_combinations_of_groups.txt	admin_enabled_email.tpl	admin_enabled_email_no_text.tpl	designated_groups_cp_body.tplObviously, the first file (the .txt file) is the basic mod and the other three filesare templates that you should copy into the places where the basic mod script tells you to copy them.2. If you are using skinmaster's forum watch mod and that modis already installed, you should not use email_posts_or messages_to_combinations_of_groups.txt but youshould instead use the following file in the contrib folder:	alternate_version_for_skinmaster_forum_watch_mod.txt	(plus the same three .tpl files listed above)3. If you are using David Hermann's forum notification mod and that forum notification modis already installed, you should not use email_posts_or messages_to_combinations_of_groups.txt but youshould instead use the following file in the contrib folder:	alternate_version_for_hermann_forum_notification_mod.txt	(plus the same three .tpl files listed above)There are a few mods out there that add additional lines in posting.php that begin with "user_notification(...".If you have one of those mods installed, make sure that you add:, $mail_to_enabled_groups, $include_text, $include_unauthorized_users, $group_id, $email_re, $board_signsright after:$notify_userin each of those lines.  If you're not sure, just search through posting.php when you are done installing this mod for:user_notification(and on each line you find it make sure that the following appears after $notify_user:, $mail_to_enabled_groups, $include_text, $include_unauthorized_users, $group_id, $email_re, $board_signsFinal point: Use easymod!!  This is a pretty long mod and most people who install it manually will make mistakesthat are hard to track down - it is MUCH easier to install this with easymod.  And if you haven’t yet installedeasymod, don’t worry, it’s very very easy (hence it’s name).Final final point: back up your files before beginning installation.
