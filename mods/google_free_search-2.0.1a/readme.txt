Thank you for choosing and downloading the Google Free Search MOD (formerly known as "Add Google Searchbar to Header")!

If you have installed a previous version of this MOD, simply use the contrib/update_x.y.z_to_2.0.1.txt file (the "x.y.z" part is the version that you have installed). 

If you have version 1.0.0 installed, you will have to manually remove the MOD and install version 2.0.1.

If this is going to be a fresh install (you have not installed a previous version of this MOD), please use the google_free_search-2.0.1.txt file.  Remember to perform backups of the files that are going to be edited before installing this MOD!  In-depth installation instructions are included in the google_free_search-2.0.1.txt file.

The Google Free code is supplied by Google at http://www.google.com/searchcode.html.  It is important that you read the Google Terms of Use at http://www.google.com/services/terms_free.html and follow the regulations written on that page.

The Google Free Search MOD is a modified version of the original Google Free code.  The modifications were made to make the code XHTML 1.0 Transitional valid, and to make it phpBB-friendly and have all the desired functions.
