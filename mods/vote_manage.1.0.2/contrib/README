The file contained in the contrib/ directory, namely "precompiled.zip", 
contains all of the files that this MOD asks you to change already mod-
ded for you--it has those files precompiled and ready to be uploaded. If
this is your first modification to your forum, or if your previous modi-
fications did not affect ANY of the files that this MOD affects, then you
may simply upload these files to their appropriate places on your web-
server, overwriting the files that were there. But PLEASE be sure that if
you have already modded your forum that those modifications were totally
disjoint from this MOD. And I really, really, really encourage you to
backup your files before you make any changes.

Note: These files were precomplied in phpBB v2.0.20. If you have a different
      version than this, then please apply the MOD manually or with easyMOD.
