1. Setting the colors the links will change to:

This MOD "fades" the links from their initial color to another color and then back. To do this, you set values three JavaScript array: fadeClasses, startColors and endColors.

To make the MOD work correctly, you just need to set the established classes (CSS) of your links that use various colors in the fadeClasses array. Always remember to leave the first option as a "".

Example:

<script>
fadeClasses = new Array("","mainmenu","name");
...

Then, set the fade to and fade from colors for each of the defined classes. Use the first option in each of these arrays as the "default" for any classes that aren't defined or anchors that don't have a class. Remember that the "startColors" should match the color of the links when they are NOT hovered over and the endColors should match the color of the links when they ARE hovered over.

Example:
<script>
fadeClasses = new Array('','mainmenu','name');
startColors = new Array('{T_BODY_LINK}','#0205FA','{T_FONCOLOR1}');
endColor = new Array('{T_BODY_HLINK}','#FA0502','{T_FONTCOLOR3}');
</script>

3. Using this MOD on NON-phpBB2 pages:

This MOD will work on any HTML/XHTML web page so you don't have to use templates. An example of how to use this MOD in another page is below:

<html>
  <head>
    <title>Your page title</title>
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Script-Type" content="text/javascript" />
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Style-Type" content="text/css" />
    <script>
			fadeClasses=new Array('','mainmenu','name');
      startColors=new Array('#123456','#000000','#12345F');
      endColor=new Array('#654321','#FFFFFF','#F54321');
    </script>
    <script src="phpBB2/templates/fade.js"></script>
    <style>
      /* CSS style declarations here */
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    Web page content here
  </body>
</html>

All you have to change is the path to the phpBB2 directory and it will work. Everything else will work the same as the instructions above EXCEPT that you won't be able to use template declarations for setting the color (i.e. startColor = 'T_FONTCOLOR1'; ) since you aren't using the templating engine.


4. Using the fader on NON-anchors

The original authors of this script (I've only added very little to it) made this script very robust. It will work on any element within a page, not just anchors!  All you have to do is set the "class" of the element you want to fade to "fade" OR by setting it to any of the class names you have defined in the fadeClasses array and the fade script will take over.  Example:

<div class="fade">I want this text to fade when I hover over it</div>

If you have already defined the class to match your style, then just nest an extra "span" inside your current element to hold the "fade" class:

<span class="smalltext">This is small <span class="fade">and this fades small</span></span>

As indicated, I did not write the code in the script. It was originally written by "Scotty" who stopped supporting the MOD at phpBB2. It was then updated for phpBB 2.0.5 by "AbelaJohnB" and finally I took over at 2.0.6. by making it so the script was more modular and able to be shared across templates. At version 2.0.8a, I updated the script with support for cross-browser functionality and to support mulitple link colors.

This MOD is supported SOLELY at phpBB.com.
