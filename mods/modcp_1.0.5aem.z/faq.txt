Q: What is this ?
A: faq.txt

Q: What does "faq.txt" mean ?
A: This file, faq.txt, is a text file which contains some basic Frequently Asked Questions. They will help you find my answer for your questions quickly. And they also save me a lot of times.

Q: Is it a phpBB MOD ?
A: Yes, but it is rather an add-on than a MOD for phpBB2

Q: Why do you write this add-on ?
A: It's not me, just a Niels project for his personal usage. After find this project i ask him to release this Mod as an individual archive :)
Then i added more support and new features on it.

Q: May I have a demo?
A: test it ^_^

Q: if i have installed other Mods on file admin_users.php, how can i use Mod CP ?
A: just edit files admin_users.php and user_edit_body.tpl

Q: can i add others modules to my moderators ?
A: sure, you can :)

Q: How can i add other modules to the Mod CP ?
A: First move your file admin_xxx.php into the modcp dir.
After, replace each lines with "admin/xxx_body.tpl" by "modcp/xxx_body.tpl" and "page_footer_admin.'.$phpEx" by "page_footer_mod.'.$phpEx"
Then move your file "templates/subSilver/admin/xxx_body.tpl" to "templates/subSilver/modcp/" directory.

Q: How can i use this Mod for older phpBB version ?
A: You should update to the latest phpBB version for a lot of thing, one is security issues ;)
Otherwise there is no reason it won't work with older version (feedback if not)

Q: How can i give more permissions to my Moderators ?
A: Add them as Admin level :)
Otherwise see the How to admin_ug_auth_install.txt

Q: How doesn't this mod cost ?

That will help Niels to support his mods and let them FREE for you (so far) ;)
