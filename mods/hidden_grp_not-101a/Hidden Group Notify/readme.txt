                                  INTRODUCTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

phpBB has many useful usergroup management features.  Among these is the ability
to create "hidden" usergroups that are not displayed to most users.  Another
good feature is an e-mail notification sent to a forum member when they are
added to a group.  One little problem with these features arises in some cases:
adding a user to a hidden group also triggers such notification, which contains
information about the hidden group!  Not so hidden, now is it?

This modification allows you to have more truly "hidden" groups, by disabling
the notification e-mail normally sent when adding a member to a hidden group.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.0.1 - October 20, 2006
Clarified one of the editing instructions. There are no functionality changes,
so updating is not needed if you have previously installed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                 INCLUDED FILES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the ZIP file for this download is unpacked, the following new directories
may be created on your system, each containing the noted files.
	contrib   - Important documents regarding usage of the download. READ THEM.
	root      - New files that will be added to your forum, if any.
	premodded - Original phpBB files, with this download already installed.
The "root" and "premodded" directories may not be present - this usually means
they are either not needed or included for this modification.
Alongside these directories, you should see a install.txt file.  This has the
install instructions.

The "contrib" directory may contain the following files:
	license.txt       - License information regarding this download.
	release_notes.txt - Short summary of changes in each version.
	changelog.txt     - Detailed list of changes to each version.
	uninstall.txt     - Instructions for uninstalling.
	upgrades/*.txt     - Instructions for upgrading from a previous version.
The "contrib" directory may also contain a file with the extension .hl, such as
"contact.hl."  This is a file for use with Nivisec's Mods/Hack List
modification.  If you don't have that modification installed, ignore this file.
If you do have it installed, then check its documentation for more on .hl files.

phpBB Smith is my personal phpBB related web site and therefore tends to have
most of my works (including older versions if needed), while the other sites
generally have some, but not all, of my stuff around somewhere.  Basically, they
all have different things, so check them all.  If you need to e-mail me, I can
be reached via a contact form at the phpBB Smith site.

Have a nice day. :D
