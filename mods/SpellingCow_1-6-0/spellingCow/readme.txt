Thanks for downloading SpellingCow!

If you already have SpellingCow installed (any version, no matter lite or full), use the update_to_1-6-0.txt file.  All it does is copy a new spell-gw.php file into place.  No editing!

Follow the spellingcow_full_1-6-0.txt for install instructions.  Should take about 5 minutes!

If you do not want the auto checking feature, install the lite version instead.  You  can add the auto checking later with an included MOD if desired.

Files:
update_to_1-6-0.txt		- for updating; words for -ALL- previously installed versions
spellingcow_full_1-6-0.txt	- for fresh installs, includes auto checking
spellingcow_lite_1-6-0.txt	- for fresh installs, no auto checking
spellingcow_auto_1-6-0.txt	- if the lite was installed, this will add auto checking
spellingcow_auto_off.txt	- if auto checking was installed, and you want to set it off by default
				  and let users set to on if they desire

Please note this MOD follows GPL and acts as a gateway to the SpellingCow Spell Checking service.  However, the SpellingCow Spell Checking service is separate and not covered by GPL, but I PROMISE it will always be free of financial obligation.  The catch is that it displays ads and requires a link back to SpellingCow.  SpellingCow reserves the right to deny its service to sites in violation of these terms.  I don't feel the ads are obtrusive (no popups or spyware) and a link back is not much to ask.  Hopefully you feel the same ;-)

Enjoy!
