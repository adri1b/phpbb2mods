Before modifying any code, please first upload and run the db_update.php file.

If you are upgrading from 1x to v2, please first run the drop_old_tables.php file *then* the db_update.php file*
*NB: you will loose any saved links during this upgrade.

The drop_old_tables.php file assumes that you are still using unmodified rEd bar 1.0.1 sql.
I cannot predict what will happen if you're not ;)
