                                  INTRODUCTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many users of the Mozilla Firefox web browser rely on it's automatic form
completion feature to save their frequently used usernames and passwords. For
phpBB administrators, this can cause problems when trying to edit a forum
member's account through the admin panel's user management area. Firefox will
often replace the username of other forum members with that of the admin and
fill in the admin's password. It doesn't cause critical issues, but it is very
annoying, often causing admins to waste time going back and redoing all their
edits to a user.

Firefox Autocomplete Bypass will prevent the auto-completion from triggering in
the user management form. By simply renaming the standard username field, the
original intended function of the page is preserved. No longer is there any need
to disable a standard Firefox feature.

When the ZIP file for this download is unpacked, the following new directories
may be created on your system, each containing the noted files.
	contrib   - Important documents regarding usage of the download. READ THEM.
	root      - New files that will be added to your forum, if any.
	premodded - Original phpBB files, with this download already installed.
The "root" and "premodded" directories may not be present - this usually means
they are either not needed or included for this modification.
Alongside these directories, you should see a file_edits.txt file.  This has the
install instructions.

The "contrib" directory may contain the following files:
	license.txt       - License information regarding this download.
	release_notes.txt - Short summary of changes in each version.
	changelog.txt     - Detailed list of changes to each version.
	upgrade*.txt      - Instructions for upgrading from a previous version.
	uninstall.txt     - Instructions for uninstalling.
The "contrib" directory may also contain a file with the extension .hl, such as
"contact.hl."  This is a file for use with Nivisec's Mods/Hack List
modification.  If you don't have that modification installed, ignore this file.
If you do have it installed, then check it includes documentation for this file.

phpBB Smith is my personal phpBB related web site and therefore tends to have
most of my works (including older versions if needed), while the other sites
generally have some, but not all, of my stuff around somewhere.  Basically, they
all have different things, so check them all.  If you need to e-mail me, I can
be reached via a contact form at the phpBB Smith site.

Have a nice day. :D
