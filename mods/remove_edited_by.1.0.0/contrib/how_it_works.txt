Remove Edited By for Admins (1.0.0)
Provided by the phpBB Doctor (www.phpBBDoctor.com)

This very simple MOD from the phpBB Doctor (www.phpBBDoctor.com) allows you to 
disable the "Edited By" message for any ADMIN edits. Some people wonder how this 
is triggered, as you might edit one post and see a change notice added to your 
post. Yet edit another post and no change notice is added. Why? 

First, here's the code: 

open includes/functions_post.php 
find  
        $edited_sql =  

After, add   

        // BEGIN No "Edit By" for ADMINS (www.phpBBDoctor.com) 
        if ($userdata['user_level'] == ADMIN) 
        { 
                $edited_sql = ''; 
        } 
        // END No "Edit By" for ADMINS (www.phpBBDoctor.com) 


So that removes the message for ADMIN users. But let's discuss the original line 
of code to understand when the code is executed. 

Code: ‹ Select ›  
        $edited_sql = ($mode == 'editpost' && !$post_data['last_post'] && $post_data['poster_post']) ? ", post_edit_time = $current_time, post_edit_count = post_edit_count + 1 " : ""; 

The first thing that's checked is if we're in "editpost" mode via $mode == 
'editpost'. The mode is set from posting.php and lets us know whether we're 
adding a new post, deleting an existing post, or - you guessed it - editing. 
Obviously we only need an "Edited by..." message if we're editing the post.  

Next, this part !$post_data['last_post'] let's us check to see if we're on the 
last post. The decision made by the phpBB developers was that there was no harm 
in editing the last post of a topic, because it's not possible for someone to 
have quoted you or responded to your comments yet. So as long as you have the 
last word on the topic, you can change it without it being documented. 

Finally this $post_data['poster_post'] allows the code to check if it is you 
editing or someone else. If a Mod or Admin edits your post, they don't get 
flagged. 

So, the bottom line... if you are editing a post that is not the last post of a 
topic, and it's your post, then you see the "Edited by..." message. If you make 
the change listed above, then ADMINs will be allowed to edit their posts no 
matter where they are on the board and not trigger this message. Hope this helps 
you understand the logic a bit more. 

What if you wanted to go the opposite route? What if you wanted to record all 
edits made by anyone, anywhere, anytime? For that you would need a new database 
table, as there is not enough room on the POSTS_TABLE to store an edit history 
by more than one person. Perhaps this will be a future MOD available in from
the phpBB Doctor.
