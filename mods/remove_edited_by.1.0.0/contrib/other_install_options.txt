Remove Edited By for Admins (1.0.0)
Provided by the phpBB Doctor (www.phpBBDoctor.com)

If you want to remove the Edited By message for moderators as well as 
Administrators use the following code segment in the After, Add operation in the 
standard MOD. Do NOT use both, use only one or the other.

	// BEGIN Remove Edited By for ADMINs, Mods 1.0.0 (www.phpBBDoctor.com) 
	if ( in_array($userdata['user_level'], array (MOD, ADMIN) ) )
	{ 
		$edited_sql = ''; 
	} 
	// END Remove Edited By for ADMINs, Mods 1.0.0 (www.phpBBDoctor.com)


If you want to remove *all* edited by messages, no matter who edits their own 
posts, use this as the After, Add operation:

	$edited_sql = '';

In both of the above cases the "Find" operation is the same as what
is in the standard MOD installation file.

This MOD does NOT remove the edited by messages from existing posts. In order to 
do that you will need to run the following SQL:

update 	phpbb_posts
set 	post_edit_time = NULL
, 	post_edit_count = 0
where 	post_edit_count > 0;

Of course be sure to change phpbb_posts to whatever your actual table name is, 
based on the prefix you selected when you installed your board.
