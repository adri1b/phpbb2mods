[2.0.19] Restrict Username Size... [February 9th, 2006]

This archive " restrict_username_size_v1_0_4.zip " contains two (2) install files.

1 ] install_restrict_username_size_v1.0.4.txt (without the javascript "remaining character counter").
2 ] install_restrict_username_size_v1_1_4_jsc.txt (including the javascript "remaining character counter").

Otherwise, these 2 files are identical.

IMPORTANT: It is strongly recommended to use EasyMOD for the installation procedure. Aside it's reliability and efficiency, it will execute the sql statment first, thus updating the "config" table, which is very important as to NOT create login problems for your members.

For those administrators who prefer updating manually, simply as an opportunity to review the code first hand or, by necessity due to heavily modded boards, DO NOT FORGET to update the "config" table for the reasons mentionned above. You have been warned! ;)

This mod was created following numerous support issues in the phpBB Support forum. It was inspired by miscellaneous solutions provided by many expert support specialists lurking there, including myself (as a non-affiliated newbie support specialist ;) ... ). We are firm believers in the "open source" projects, specifically phpBB and support this movement with our time and efforts.

Trusting this mod to fulfill your expectations, enjoy!
