The install instructions for v1.2.6 are in the contrib folder
if you don't feel like having too much functions.
Also some compliancy instructions are there.

Features:
v1.2.6:
 - descriptions
 - some basic permissions

v1.11.22
 - permission settings
 - topic tooltips with the first post
 - more configuration and user specific configuration
 - turning descriptions into links to the poster's profile
 - configurable maximum tooltip image size (so we dont' get boggled with huge images)
 
 v1.12.0
  - ACP configurable HTML/bbcode/smiley parsing within the descriptions (bbcode does not hinder the length limit)

v1.13.0
- BBCode hatelist, very useful for preventing images in descriptions and things like that
- limiting the size of post previews in the tooltips, also very useful
- and thanks to an idea of "some dude who's nick I can't remember" I added a counter for characters when posting desceriptions

v1.14.0

  a list of possibilities can be found at http://www.walterzorn.com/tooltip/tooltip_e.htm
  
v1.15.0
- lots and lots of speed improvements
