Thier are no garantees that the premodified files will work and as such unless thier is an error on my part, I will not support them.

All of the premodified files were created useing easymod.  If you are useing the premodified files, then I suggest that you use easymod, as the install instructions WILL work on a vanilla version.

Upload everything to your forum folder, excludeing the file you are reading now.

The install script will automatically run the proper queries.

Delete the install_color folder when it is done.
