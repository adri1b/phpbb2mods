I may change the supported versions at my discretion and/or without notice as they are updated at http://www.phpbb.com/ and http://ptifo.clanmckeen.com/

I only support the latest releases because I don't have time to work with outdated releases.  Thier are specific reasons as to why versions advance over time ;)
