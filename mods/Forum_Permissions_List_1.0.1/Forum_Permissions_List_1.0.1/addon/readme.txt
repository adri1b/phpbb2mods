The instructions in this directory explain how to use this MOD if you already have other MODs installed which make changes to admin_forumauth.php and you want to be able to control and view those same permissions using this MOD.

All the instructions assume that you have already installed the other MOD, and this MOD before you use them.

The following MODs are supported at this time:
	Attachment MOD

If you wish to use a MOD which is not listed, but which makes changes to admin_forumauth.php try applying the same changes to admin_forumauth_list.php. In most cases, this will work, but if you have trouble with a particular MOD, you should ask in the support topic for this MOD, giving details of the problem, and a link to the MOD in question.
