## MOD History:
##
##   2005-03-04	- Version 1.0.17c
##		  made additional minor changes required for mod validation (no changes in functionality)
##
##   2005-02-19	- Version 1.0.17b
##		  made additional minor changes required for mod validation (no changes in functionality)
##
##   2005-01-28	- Version 1.0.17a
##		  made minor changes required for mod validation (no changes in functionality)
##
##   2005-01-10	- Version 1.0.17
##		  added draft prune functions (note that auto prune will only work if you enable pruning in the ACP configuration page);
##		  changed draft delete checkbox to draft delete button; added number of drafts and drafts per user to Forum stats in ACP;
##		  fixed a post count and pagination error in search.php; fixed an error where if the user clicked to
##		  page 2 or higher in the draft and post list and then went back to page 1 the draft list would no longer be there;
##		  changed it so that a guest who is not logged in will not see the save as drafts button; and
##		  deleted a spurious reference to switch_not_save_a_draft_button that is no longer needed as a result of version 1.0.16 changes.
##
##   2004-11-15	- Version 1.0.16
##		  fixed the treatment of polls in drafts so that they do not get lost when the draft is submitted as a real post;
##		  corrected small error in prune.php that would result in pruning deleting drafts; and simplified posting_body.tpl so that
##		  it no longer uses a <!-- END switch_not_save_as_draft_button --> concept (so that privmsg.php will not get messed up for people with PCP mod); as a result, got rid of all changes to privmsg.php
##
##   2004-10-04	- Version 1.0.15
##		  corrected small error in functions_admin.php that counted drafts as posts when it tries to sync a single topic.
##
##   2004-09-18	- Version 1.0.14
##		  corrected small error in search.php that allowed it to count a draft as a new post when you click the new posts link on the index page;
##		  also corrected problem in functions_admin.php that counted drafts as posts when it tries to sync a forum or topic (e.g. when you hit 'resync' in the forum management part of the ACP);
##		  and modified things so that a user who isn't generally authorized to delete his own posts can now delete his own drafts
##
##   2004-09-05	- Version 1.0.13
##		  no change in functionality...just changed method of inserting draft as a new post when you finally submit a draft (since method used in version 1.0.11 had some unnecessary steps in it);
##
##   2004-09-02	- Version 1.0.12
##		  broke up large find and replace blocks in mod to smaller bits as needed to get validation...no change in the coding from version 1.1.11;
##
##   2004-08-29	- Version 1.0.11
##		  changed mod so that it in effect creates a brand new post (with a new post_id and, if the post is a new topic, a brand new topic_id) when a draft finally gets submitted;
##		  the old draft post (and topic if the draft is a new topic) get deleted when the new one is created;
##		  since post_id now will always fall in same order as post_time, got rid of the changes that had been in prior drafts to places where sorts were done by post_id;
##		  as a result, the order of post_id of all final posts is now the same as the order of post_time of all final posts (not critical but nice);
##		  also fixed a minor error where a BEGIN_TRANSACTION statement did not have a corresponding END_TRANSACTION statement when the user saved the post as a draft (which
##		  could have slowed up the board a bit when a user saves a draft)
##
##   2004-08-22	- Version 1.0.10
##		  tweaked the mod so that post_id and topic_id get updated at the time the draft is finally submitted as real (so that there are never any 'sort' bugs)
##
##   2004-08-20	- Version 1.0.9
##		  corrected the fix in 1.0.8
##
##   2004-08-20	- Version 1.0.8
##		  fixed an error that prevented any regular users who are not moderators from deleting their own drafts
##
##   2004-08-06	- Version 1.0.7
##		  fixed aditional errors in viewtopic that could have caused wrong displays when user hits newest or previous or next in a topic where there are unsubmitted drafts
##
##   2004-08-05	- Version 1.0.6
##		  fixed an error in viewtopic that caused wrong pagination on occassion when there were umsubmitted drafts in a topic
##
##   2004-07-24	- Version 1.0.5
##		  fixed a number of minor bugs and cleaned up code
##
##   2004-07-23	- Version 1.0.4

##
##   2004-07-23	- Version 1.0.2
