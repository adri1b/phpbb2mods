                          UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To uninstall this modification on a phpBB forum, follow these steps.

1) If you have not done so already, unpack ZIP file you have downloaded.  This
   will create new directories and files as described the readme.txt file.

   But, you've probably already done this step since you're reading this file,
   right?

2) In this step, you will remove edits from your forum files.  All of the needed
   instructions for doing this are listed in the file_edits.txt file.  Open this
   file in your favorite text editor, such as Notepad, Wordpad, PHPEdit, or
   EditPlus.  If you use Dreamweaver for this step, be CERTAIN that you have
   activated the "Code" mode of that program, or you will have problems later.

   If you installed the version of the modification for Categories Hierarchy, 
   use the categories_hierarchy.txt file instead of file_edits.txt.

   Check the file for an Author's Notes section near the top for any special
   instructions that you may need to follow.  If there are none, or no Author's
   Notes at all, look near the top for a section labeled "Files To Edit."  If
   you have unchanged backups of these files, replace the current files with
   your backups.  Doing this will reverse any changes made to the current files
   since the backup files were created.
   
   For any files for which you do not have backups, make the changes to those
   files described in file_edits.txt in reverse.  For example, if there is a
   FIND action followed by a REPLACE WITH action, locate the REPLACE WITH code
   in your file and replace it with the FIND code.  For any ADD or similar
   actions, find and delete the code that was added during installation.
