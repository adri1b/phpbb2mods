Version 2.0.3 - September 15, 2006
Repackaged for submission to phpBB.com.
A lot of people had trouble installing the last version due to the Inline
actions, so I've replaced those with After, add actions.  There are no
significant changes, so upgrading is really not needed.  An upgrade instruction
has been added, though.

Version 2.0.2 - June 30, 2005
For a minor update, I've consolidated two of the code changes into one. It will
make for less work in future installations and adaptations to other files.
Updated contact information and other documentation.
Officially tested on and compatible with phpBB 2.0.15 - 2.0.17.

Version 2.0.1 - Aug 22, 2003
Added some changes to viewtopic.php so that it would show guests that haven't
voted the poll form.

Version 2.0.0 - Aug 22, 2003
Now I've gone and done it!  I updated the one mod I thought I would never
change.  Allow Guest Voting now features simple IP tracking.  This form of
tracking is not perfect, but it is now included.
Added readme.txt, gpl.txt, and allow_guest_voting.hl.

Version 1.0.0
Initial release.
