                                  INTRODUCTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Allow Guest Voting was created to allow board administrators to enable voting in
forum polls by users that are not logged in on their forums.  This is not
possible in default phpBB installations because the phpBB Group has reservations
against it.  Attempting to set forum permissions that would enable guest voting
results in the permission being set for registered users.

This modification, intended for site administrators who simply want to have some
relaxing and fun polls, allows a board administrator to set the voting
permission to all users on a per forum basis.  This means that you can have one
or two forums where guests can vote and one or two where they cannot, should you
desire.  Also included is a rudimentary form of IP tracking.

-Allow logged out members and guests to vote in polls.
-Works with existing forum permission system.  Small and simple.
-Checks guest votes against phpBB-recorded IP addresses of previous votes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.0.3 - September 15, 2006
Repackaged for submission to phpBB.com.
A lot of people had trouble installing the last version due to the Inline
actions, so I've replaced those with After, add actions.  There are no
significant changes, so upgrading is really not needed.  An upgrade instruction
has been added, though.

                                 INCLUDED FILES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the ZIP file for this download is unpacked, the following new directories
may be created on your system, each containing the noted files.
	contrib   - Important documents regarding usage of the download. READ THEM.
	root      - New files that will be added to your forum, if any.
	premodded - Original phpBB files, with this download already installed.
The "root" and "premodded" directories may not be present - this usually means
they are either not needed or included for this modification.
Alongside these directories, you should see a file_edits.txt file.  This has the
install instructions.

The "contrib" directory may contain the following files:
	license.txt       - License information regarding this download.
	release_notes.txt - Short summary of changes in each version.
	changelog.txt     - Detailed list of changes to each version.
	upgrade*.txt      - Instructions for upgrading from a previous version.
	uninstall.txt     - Instructions for uninstalling.
The "contrib" directory may also contain a file with the extension .hl, such as
"contact.hl."  This is a file for use with Nivisec's Mods/Hack List
modification.  If you don't have that modification installed, ignore this file.
If you do have it installed, then check it includes documentation for this file.

phpBB Smith is my personal phpBB related web site and therefore tends to have
most of my works (including older versions if needed), while the other sites
generally have some, but not all, of my stuff around somewhere.  Basically, they
all have different things, so check them all.  If you need to e-mail me, I can
be reached via a contact form at the phpBB Smith site.

Have a nice day. :D
