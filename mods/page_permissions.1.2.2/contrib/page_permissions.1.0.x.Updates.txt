Update instructions from 1.0.0 or 1.0.1 to 1.0.2
I changed the name of the cache file to match the rest of the MOD
file names. I also standardized the cache functions to make it
easier for me to use them in other MODs. In order to do that, I
removed the /admin cache file and replaced it with a generic version
located in the /includes folder instead.

This file (the one you are reading) does not use the standard 
template.

File Operations
Rename cache/cache_pages.php to cache/cache_page_permissions.php
Remove admin/phpbbdoctor_cache_functions.php

Copy Operations - copy from the MOD zip and overwrite existing files

# This is a replacement cache functions file
copy root/functions_phpbbdoctor_cache.php to includes/functions_phpbbdoctor_cache.php

# This is the new page permissions language file and the
# language file for the cache system, both are new files
copy root/lang_admin_page_permissions.php to language/lang_english/lang_admin_page_permissions.php
copy root/lang_phpbbdoctor_cache.php to language/lang_english/lang_phpbbdoctor_cache.php

# overwrite your existing page permissions file with the new copy
# as provided
copy root/page_permissions.php to includes/page_permissions.php


# The following is a new edit that is required in order to
# use the new standardized cache functions
#
#-----[ OPEN ]-------------------------------------
#
common.php

#
#-----[ FIND ]-------------------------------------
# On or about line 190 to 190, may not represent a complete row
#
include($phpbb_root_path . 'includes/db.'.$phpEx);

#-----[ AFTER, ADD ]-------------------------------------
# Special Instructions: See code comments for details about
# this AFTER, ADD operation...

// BEGIN phpBBDoctor Cache Library (www.phpBBDoctor.com)

// no harm in adding them more than once, but there is no

{
        include($phpbb_root_path . 'includes/functions_phpbbdoctor_cache.'.$phpEx);

# Now you'll want to update the code in functions.php
# This is where the original single-line edit was done,
# now we also have to load the language file. Simply
# remove the existing line that loads the page permissions
# module and replace it with the new code shown below.

		include($phpbb_root_path . 'language/lang_' . $board_config['default_lang'] . '/lang_admin_page_permissions.' . $phpEx);
	}
	// Next, the main permissions module
	include_once($phpbb_root_path . 'includes/page_permissions.php');
	// END Page Permissions 1.0.2 (www.phpBBDoctor.com)

# Finally, we remove all of the language entries from the lang_admin.php file.
# Open the language/lang_english/lang_admin.php file, find and remove all lines
# related to this MOD. The are listed below:

# Find and remove all of the following, these lines are now located
