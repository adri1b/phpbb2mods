Update instructions from 1.0.2 to 1.1.0

Note: These instructions assume that you have a working version
of the Page Permissions MOD on your board. If you do not have a 
working version then these instructions might not help.

Step 1.
Run the following SQL, be sure to alter the table prefix if
you have changed yours:

alter table phpbb_pages
add disabled_message varchar(255) default '';

Step 2.
Overwrite all files provided with this MOD, including the cache file

Step 3.
Log in to your admin panel
Click the "rebuild cache" option to refresh your cache

Step 4, (optional)
If you are using the eXtreme Styles MOD then please see the author
notes for this MOD. The cache file has been renamed, and if you don't
update your eXtreme Styles code then the cache file is subject to being
removed. The MOD Author Notes provided with 1.0.x were not updated
properly, with 1.1.0 (this version) they are.

Step 5.
Verify that your board is working as expected

That's it. If you want to know what has changed as far as the files
that you overwrote in step 2, here's a summary:

admin/admin_page_permissions 
	contains code to edit the disabled message
cache/cache_page_permissions.php

	with an empty file in order to ensure everything gets
	reset properly
