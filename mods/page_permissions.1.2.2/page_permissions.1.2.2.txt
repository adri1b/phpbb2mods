## Author Notes:
## This MOD is designed to allow board administrators to control access at the page
## level rather than at the forum level. It is not intended to replace the existing
## phpBB permission system but to supplement it.
## 
## For example, a common request is to "protect" the member list by preventing
## guests from viewing that page. Or perhaps even only allowing board moderators to
## view that information. This MOD will do that. It can also handle pages with
## different functions such as profile.php (which handles editing profiles, viewing
## profiles, and even new user registrations).
## 
## This MOD also sets up a page view counter for each page that you specify. Page
## counts are incremented based on MEMBER or GUEST viewing, and can be reset at any
## time.
## 
## Finally, you can disable individual pages. If a page is disabled users with
## ADMIN permissions can still view the pages, which will allow you to work on the
## page without other board members seeing what is going on. Want to shut down new
## user registrations? Simply set the profile page with mode of "register" to ADMIN
## and nobody will be able to register. Want to keep guests from viewing member
## profiles? Want to restrict access to a custom php page to members of a specific
## group? This MOD can do all of that. You can even set up a custom message (one
## language only) for each page that you disable.
## 
## Access levels include:
## Guest
## Registered
## Private
## Moderator
## Administrator
## 
## Note that there is a loophole with "moderator" permissions. Users that have ever
## been a moderator of something may still have a user_level value of "2", which
## means that they can still appear as a Moderator. This is not a problem with this
## MOD, and to the best of my knowledge has been fixed in the latest versions of
## phpBB. One quick fix that is very easy to do: Go into your admin panel and make
## the user an Administrator and then set them back to User right away. That will
## reset the phpbb_users.user_level field to 0 (user) rather than 2 (moderator).
## 
## What about non-phpBB Pages?
## This MOD can be used to set permissions for *any* page in your board, even
## something that is not a part of the standard phpBB distribution. You must,
## however, include the phpBB session handler in order for this to work. At the
## current time all pages must be in the same directory as the forum. There is a
## file (newpage.zip) in the contrib folder of this MOD that will show you how to
## do that.
## 
## Permissions Hierarchy
## A page may have different permissions based on different URL parameters. One
## valid parameter is "no" parameter. In older versions this MOD would first find
## the match for a page with no parameter and use the permission settings at that
## level for all accesses to that page, even if there was a potential match for the
## URL parameters. You can now have different permissions for a page both with and
## without URL parameters and it should work correctly.
## 
## Default Page Permissions and $phpEx
## There are some default page permissions supplied as SQL "insert" statements in
## the MOD install instructions. The page type is hard-coded to "php" and does NOT
## use the $phpEx variable used within phpBB. If you do not use ".php" as your file
## type (for example if you use .php4 or .php3) then you will need to update the
## data using the admin page provided before any of your pages will actually be
## protected by this MOD. Nothing bad will happen to your files, they just won't be
## protected until you update the data for the permissions table to match your
## actual server configuration. The SQL insert statements are provided to create
## some initial data value, not code, and therefore $phpEx is not used.
## 
## eXtreme Styles MOD
## If you have this MOD installed you need to make a small change to one of the
## files to keep it from removing the Page Permissions cache file when a "clear
## all" process is run. Open admin/xs_cache.php and find the following code:
## $skip_files = array(
## 	'.',
## 	'..',
## 	'.htaccess',
## 	'index.htm',
## 	'index.html',
## 	'index.php',
## 	'attach_config.php',
## 	);
## 
## Inline find );
## Before, add
## 	'cache_page_permissions.php'
## 
## Note that in my version this line 
## 	'attach_config.php',
## has an extra comma at the end, which should not be there. If your version does
## not have this extra comma then you will need to add one in order to avoid a
## syntax error, then add in the extra line as noted above. The final block of code
## should look something like this:
## $skip_files = array(
## 	'.',
## 	'..',
## 	'.htaccess',
## 	'index.htm',
## 	'index.html',
## 	'index.php',
## 	'attach_config.php',
## 	'cache_page_permissions.php'
## 	);
##
## Please install and test only ONE new MOD at a time. That may seem like common
## sense, but you would be amazed at how often this is not done. :-)
##
## Install Time Estimate
## The MOD install time is assumed to be for a manual install and is based on the
## number of files to edit. If you use an automatic installer the time estimate
## is essentially meaningless. We do not test with EasyMOD but our MODs should
## work based on our usage of the proper template. Note that EasyMOD seems to
## have issues with certain SQL structures that work fine in MySQL directly.
##
## FIND Line Number Hints
## Some of the FIND operations may have line numbers associated with the
## operation. These line numbers are derived from a set of baseline phpBB code
## and are generally approximations only. Use them as a guideline if you find
## more than one line in a similar location. Note that as you add new lines to
## the file as you are editing that the line numbers for the remaining portion
## of that file are nearly always going to be wrong. We do not guarantee that
## there will be line numbers on each FIND.
##
## Some actions have additional comments. Please review them as they are
## intended to help you understand the exact steps required to complete that
## specific action.
##
## This MOD has 27 install instructions.
## This MOD is in FINAL status as of version 1.2.2.
