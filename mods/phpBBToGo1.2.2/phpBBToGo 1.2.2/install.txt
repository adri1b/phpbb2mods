phpBBToGo Installation

For a quick installation open this file (phpbbtogo.php)
in a text editor and adjust the forum number(s) from which
the topics will be fetched.

Find the line:
 
	$CFG['mobile_forums'] = array(1,2);
 
and set this to the forum id(s) which exists at your forum.
 
If you do not know your forum id(s) open your forum with a
browser and point your mouse over a forum link. Look at
the status bar of your browser to see the link URL. It
should be something like:

	http://yoursite.com/phpBB/viewforum.php?f=1

The parameter 'f=1' indicates your forum id.

Copy the phpBBToGo directory, in ASCII mode, to your web-site.

To view your mobile web-site, browse to:
		
	http://yoursite.com/phpBBToGo/forums.php
