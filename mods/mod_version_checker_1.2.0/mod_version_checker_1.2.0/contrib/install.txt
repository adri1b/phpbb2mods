## Author Notes: 
##
##	- Instructions :
##
##	This is what the mod offers:
##
##	* Admins are able to find which of their installed mods have new versions out, just by pressing one button.
##	  The mod checks only the phpBB MODDB for new versions, so mods in the development phase cannot be checked.
##
##	* Admins are able to update the mod's database with the mods they have installed, using one of the following 3 methods:
##
##		o Entering manually the mod details (name, author, version, category)
##		o Parsing the install.txt (or .mod) file of the mod. MODX (.xml) install files are supported too.
##		o Transferring the mods from Easymod's database
##
##	* Admins are able to add/edit/delete installed mods. 
##	  Admins are not able to install/uninstall mods using this mod (this is EasyMOD's job).
##
##	* Admins are able to add mods from Easymod's database. This means that you when you install mods using Easymod, 
##	  there is no need to add them in the mod's database manually. Just press a button and they are there.
##
##	* Admins are able to choose which ones of their installed mods they want to check for new versions.
##
##	* Admins are able to download new versions of their installed mods. 
##
##
##	- Notes : 
##
##	* You'll find this mod under "MOD Center" in your Admin CP. If you already have EasyMOD installed, then both mods will be
##	  under the same label.
##
##	* When you add a new mod, you can also add the category where it belongs to. If you don't know it, you can leave it
##	  to "Unknown" and the mod will try to find it the next time you check for this mod's update. 
##	  If the mod is found in the MODDB while checking, then the mod's category is updated to show the right one.
##
##	  Please note that when you have a mod's category to "Unknown", this causes bigger delay when checking for updates, 
##	  since all categories have to be checked; so this is not recommended. This is why by default a mod's checkbox becomes unchecked 
##	  when it belongs to the Unknown category.
##
##	* Mods that are reported as mods belonging to unknown categories, although they have been checked, are mods
##	  that weren't found in the MODDB at all.
##
##	* There are 2 different cases why a mod cannot be found when checking:
##
##	  1) Mods that actually exist in the MODDB, but have a misspelling in their title.
##	  In order to check for updates for these mods, you can change their title (by choosing "edit", next to each mod's name)
##	  so they agree with the one in the MODDB, or complain to the phpBB mod team to correct their MODDB.
##
##	  2) Mods that don't exist in the MODDB.
##	  I'm sorry, but you can't do anything about these mods.
##
##	* If you have EasyMOD installed you have the option of transferring EasyMOD installed mods to the mod's own table.
##	  That way you can easily check for updates for all your EasyMOD installed mods.
##
##	  When you add the EasyMOD installed mods, you are given 2 choices:
##		a) Add them in the mod's table, if the mods are not already there
##		b) Update the ones in the mod's table, if they are already there
##
##	  Please note that although EasyMOD stores each mod version as a "different" mod, this mod displays only the latest 
##	  version of each mod (based on unique mod_title) when showing the EasyMOD mods.
##	  So if you have 10 mods installed with EasyMOD and 3 of them are just new versions of another 3, this mod will display only 
##	  the 7 mods that are unique.
##
##
##	- Special Notes :
##
##	* Mod uses the class "postlink" which is included in the default theme of subSilver. If your theme doesn't use this class,
##	  you'll have to copy/create it from subSilver or change its name in the mod's code with a class that your theme uses.
##
##	* When your server's php is running in safe mode, there might be a very small php execution timeout configured,
##	  usually 30 secs. Since i don't know if the fread() function counts against this time, there might be some problems
##	  while fetching the MODDB data if your server is connected using a low speed to the internet.
##
##
##	- Updating from previous versions :
##
##	* To update from 1.0.x versions to 1.0.2 just copy over (overwrite) all files.
##
##	* To update from 1.0.x versions to 1.2.0 you have to execute the following sql query and then copy (overwrite) all files as usual.
##
##	  ALTER TABLE `phpbb_mods_version` ADD `mod_topic_id` mediumint(8) unsigned NOT NULL default '0' AFTER `mod_author` ;
