## Author Notes: 
## 
## This MOD replaces the phpBB Version Checker with a brand new version check system that can find the latest version of any MOD that supports it.
##
## TWO-PART INSTALLATION:
## You are currently viewing Part 2 of the MOD's installation. Part 1 is required for all installations of Advanced Version Check. Part 2 is required if you are using version 2.1.1 or later of Ptirhiik's Categories Hierarchy MOD. Install it IMMEDIATELY after installing Part 1.
##
## ADVANCED VERSION CHECK IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH PHPBB RELEASES PRIOR TO PHPBB 2.0.19! If you are not using 2.0.19 or later, update NOW.#### Advanced Version Check is NOT compatible with Categories Hierarchy 2.1.5; only CH 2.1.1-2.1.4. The Version Checking methods are adjusted in CH 2.1.5, and Ptirhiik intends for CH 2.1.5 to be strictly a development line. The next major release of AVC, AVC 3.2.0, will support CH 2.1.6.
##
## TEXT TEMPLATE:
## These Text MOD Template files are provided because at the time of writing, EasyMOD is not compatible with the MODX Template. Note that before you install with EasyMOD you will need to move these files to the root directory of this MOD (where install_part1.xml is) before you upload the MOD and install with EasyMOD! Failure to do this will cause the EasyMOD installation to fail.

## LICENSE:
## Advanced Version Check is released under the GNU General Public License, either version 2 or (at your option) any later version. By installing this MOD, you state that you agree to the terms laid out in the license and will abide by them. A copy of the license can be found at docs/LICENSE.txt.

## Advanced Version Check is Copyright 2005-2006 Douglas Bell.#### HOW TO USE:## AVC documentation can be found in docs/userguide.txt in this zip.#### CONTRIBUTIONS:## Thanks to DemonBob < http://www.systemoverload.net > who helped out as secondary MOD author during the 1.1.x and 2.0.x release lines, and who contributed most of the code during those release lines. Much of it has also been passed onto AVC 3.
## The JavaScript for the admin_version.php interface was borrowed from the Admin Userlist MOD by wGEric < http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=117359 >.## Thanks to Ptirhiik < http://ptifo.clanmckeen.com > for giving me advice with the Categories Hierarchy integration!## The xml class script was designed by the phpBB Support Team and is used with permission. < http://www.phpbb.com/about/#7330 >## Thanks so much to my colleagues on the phpBB Group who have helped out with debugging AVC.## The Version Check Notification utilizes phpBB's emailer() class (included within phpBB), an adaptation of netclectic's insert_post() function, and an adaptation of wGEric's insert_pm() function.## The AVC Install script is adapted from markus_petrux's SQL Parser < http://sql.phpmix.com >.#### MOD AUTHORS:## If you want to add an AVC 3-compatible version checker to your MOD, it's really easy! Seriously! The guide and the files you need are in the avc_mod-authors/ directory in the docs/ directory in this zip, and it literally takes as little as 5 minutes to set up.#### UPDATES:
## No updates are provided from previous release lines of Advanced Version Check, because there are overwhelming changes from previous releases. Updates for releases since 2.1.3 can be found in the updates/ directory.#### DOWNLOAD & SUPPORT:## Support is available at this MOD's topic at phpBB.com < http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=277654 >. The MOD can also be downloaded from my site at < http://foamods.sourceforge.net >. At that page, you can also view the MOD's Subversion repository, and can subscribe to its mailing list.
