Advanced Version Check is a system which can check for the latest version of phpBB and any phpBB MODs that support Advanced Version Check.
Any MOD that includes an avc_*.php file (where * can be anything) supports AVC. To make AVC aware of the MOD, simply upload the file to the admin/avc_mods/ directory on your phpBB installation. AVC will then add this MOD to its records.

AVC checks its records against a remotely located file that the MOD author maintains. You can see details of these records on the Version Check admin panel (under the Version Check category). On this page, all of the MODs that AVC is currently checking for is listed, as well as a summary of the latest version checking results. Green text indicates that you are running the latest version of the MOD. Red indicates that you aren't and need to update. Black indicates that there was an error with the check.
By clicking on the More Info button (JavaScript must be turned on) next to each MOD, more information will be shown. This includes the Current Version, Latest Version, MOD Status (if applicable), Download Link, Author's Notes (when applicable), and when the check was last run. By clicking on Run Check, you can immediately run that individual check again.

On the Enable/Disable Checkers admin panel (under the Version Check category), you can determine which version checkers you want AVC to run. Any check that is disabled will be ignored by AVC, and no info for that MOD will be displayed on the Version Check page.

On the Admin Index, AVC adds a line to the Forum Statistics. This will indicate at all times the current installed version of phpBB you are using, and whether or not it is up to date. A link to download phpBB is also provided.
If it is turned on (see later section on Version Check Configuration), a Version Check section will display below the Forum Statistics. This section will list any MODs that are not up-to-date, as well as the current installed version, their latest version, and a download link. If all MODs are up-to-date, it will mention this in green text.

The Update Log (under the Version Check category) displays a log of AVC-related actions that occurred, as well as which MOD they occurred with and when. Checking the checkbox next to an entry and clicking on the Delete Selected Entries button will delete that entry from the database. Alternatively, the Select All and Unselect All links at the bottom of the page can be used (JavaScript required).

The Version Check Configuration panel allows you to configure various parts of AVC. This panel lets you determine how often checks are automatically run, whether or not to run checks in the background (when AVC is not being viewed), whether or not to show the Admin Index Summary, and whether or not to send notifications when a MOD has been updated.

Lastly, the Download phpBB panel (under the Version Check category) provides a plethora of links to download phpBB, as well as other useful links.

Frequently Asked Questions:
->	I have lots of MODs installed, but none of them show up in AVC!
Only MODs that include an avc_*.php file support AVC; AVC is not able to auto-detect installed MODs on your board unless it includes this file. You may wish to ask the author of a MOD to create one (politely!), however this is completely up to them.
-> Is there a list of MODs that support AVC somewhere?
AVC and the code for allowing a MOD to support AVC is released under the GNU General Public License as open-source, meaning that it is not tracked in any way. This means that the code is just "out there" for anyone to use, so it would be impossible to create an accurate and comprehensive list. Therefore, I have not attempted to create a list.
->	I want to have my MODs support AVC!
There's a complete guide to do it which can be found in the docs/ directory.
->	I can't find the code I'm supposed to find in templates/subSilver/admin/index_body.tpl!
If you're editing the subSilver template, this indicates that you are using a phpBB release prior to 2.0.12. Please update to the latest release of phpBB and install again.
If you're using another template, then this template has not been updated to the changes of 2.0.12 (and updates in later versions!). Check with the author of the template, or if you know what phpBB version the template is released for, run the code changes yourself.
-> The Version Check section of the Admin Index is at the very bottom!
If you're using the subSilver template, this indicates that you are using a phpBB release prior to 2.0.19, as 2.0.19 moved the Version Information section up. You should update your installation of phpBB.
Other templates have not been required by the phpBB Styles Team to move up the Version Information section after the release of phpBB 2.0.19, which interferes with this MOD. However, move the code that AVC adds to that file above the line where you find {L_WHO_IS_ONLINE} and it will be moved to the preferred location.
