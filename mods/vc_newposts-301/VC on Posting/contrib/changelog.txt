Version 3.0.1
-Fixed a bug in Photo Visual Confirmation support that would break the photos
 on posting. I missed one lousy line in vc.php *sigh*


Version 3.0.0
-Fixed a bug in the website field check.  It wasn't respecting the number of
 posts setting, as the ACP stated it would.
-Website checking is not performed for anyone with a user_level higher than
 USER (administrators, moderators, probably junior admins, etc.).
-Added support for Better Captcha 1.0.1.
-I've tested the mod with Visual confirmation 1.0.0 by Ptirhiik, and it works
 fine on the "Standard phpBB or compatible configuration" setting.


Version 2.0.0
-Added support for Photo Visual Confirmation 1.0.0 - 1.0.1a by Josh Yelon.
-Added support for FreeCap Visual Confirmation 0.0.3 by A_Jelly_Doughnut.
-Added Admin Panel controls, at the bottom of the General > Configuration page.
-Added visual confirmation for guests. They can be new posters, too.
-Added Website Check feature.
	-This checks to see if the user's website (from their profile) is mentioned
	 in their post. If it is, an error is thrown. It should stop some of the
	 spammers, at least those that use the profile field.
-Added language file, mainly for the ACP controls.
-Moved posting_body.tpl edits to new template files.
-Added installer file.
-A few tweaks here and there for submission to phpBB.com.
