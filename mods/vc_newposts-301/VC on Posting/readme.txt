                                  INTRODUCTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tired of getting hit by bots that register on your forum just to make junk spam
posts?  You can add another layer of protection against these fiends with Visual
Confirmation on New Posters.  This modification integrates the phpBB visual
confirmation system with posting to require newly registered members and guests
to enter a code before their post is entered in your database. Posts from new
members can also be blocked if the message contains the contents of their
website profile field.

To avoid inconveniencing your legitimate members, you can set the number of
posts for which new members must enter visual confirmation.

                                 INCLUDED FILES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the ZIP file for this download is unpacked, the following new directories
may be created on your system, each containing the noted files.
	contrib   - Important documents regarding usage of the download. READ THEM.
	root      - New files that will be added to your forum, if any.
	premodded - Original phpBB files, with this download already installed.
The "root" and "premodded" directories may not be present - this usually means
they are either not needed or included for this modification.
Alongside these directories, you should see a file_edits.txt file.  This has the
install instructions.

The "contrib" directory may contain the following files:
	license.txt       - License information regarding this download.
	release_notes.txt - Short summary of changes in each version.
	changelog.txt     - Detailed list of changes to each version.
	upgrade*.txt      - Instructions for upgrading from a previous version.
	uninstall.txt     - Instructions for uninstalling.
The "contrib" directory may also contain a file with the extension .hl, such as
"contact.hl."  This is a file for use with Nivisec's Mods/Hack List
modification.  If you don't have that modification installed, ignore this file.
If you do have it installed, then check it includes documentation for this file.

phpBB Smith is my personal phpBB related web site and therefore tends to have
most of my works (including older versions if needed), while the other sites
generally have some, but not all, of my stuff around somewhere.  Basically, they
all have different things, so check them all.  If you need to e-mail me, I can
be reached via a contact form at the phpBB Smith site.

Have a nice day. :D
