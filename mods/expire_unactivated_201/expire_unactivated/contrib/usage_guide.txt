This mod adds the ability for the admin to delete all unactivated user accounts from the Phpbb database. 
This does NOT affect users who have already activated their accounts but are temporarily listed as unactivated due to a 
admin process or password failure. The only user accounts that are deleted are accounts that were registered but the user
never clicked the email link to fully activate their account. Typically these accounts relate to spammers who want to get
their website links in your memberlist for Google pagerank or other SEO reasons.

Usage:
The mod adds a new section to your admin area under the "User Admin" section called "Expire Unactivated Users". By clicking 
this link you will be taken to the form to activate either the manaul expiration function, or to activate/deactivate the automated version of the mod.
To Manually activate the function simply choose a timeframe from the "select timeframe" dropdown box and click the submit button. To
activate the automated version of the function (which works exactly like the Prune function already in Phpbb), choose a timeframe from
the "select timeframe" dropdown list and then click the "Activate Automation" button. The function will show your current automation state (on or off),
the currently selected automated timeframe, and the last time the automated function was run. The automated function runs
whenever a mod or admin goes to a forum view (so not the main index view, but actually entering a forum). Keep this in mind 
when you select your automated timeframe. You may still manually activate the function if automation is turned on.
To deactivate the function sinply click the "Deactivate Automation" button.
