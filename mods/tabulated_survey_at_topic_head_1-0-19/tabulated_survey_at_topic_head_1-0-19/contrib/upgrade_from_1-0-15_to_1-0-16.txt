## Author Notes:	This is just an upgrade mod.  To use it, you must have tabulated survey at topic head version 1.0.14 or 1.0.14a already installed
##			If you haven't already installed that mod, install the latest version of this mod directly and don't use this mod at all.
##
##			Note that if you use my clone mod, you'll need to execute the FIND and REPLACE that starts in line 219 twice since that line occurs twice in posting.php
##
##			Note also that I have posted some of the changes on phpbb.com before, so make sure you don't replicate what you've already changed.
##			Specifically, some people may already have done the FIND and AFTER, ADD commands that start in lines 370 and 388 of this file

## MOD History:
##
##   2005-12-10	- Version 1.0.16 (a minor upgrade)
##		  changed 'all users' selection to 'all registered users' (allowing unregistered users to take surveys makes
##		  no sense since any unregistered user could vote multiple times in a single survey)
##
##		  added a mod to the mod in the contrib folder that will allow admin to set survey creation permissions in ACP
##		  in the same way the admin can fine tune permissions for other phpbb actions
##
##		  updated the readme that appears in the contrib folder
##
##   2005-11-20	- Version 1.0.15
##		  fixed another error that prevented second fill-in survey button (the one next to the reply button) from working
##
##		  fixed error to ensure that only users who are active in a group taking a survey will be able to take the survey
##		  (previously, anyone whose membership in a group was pending would be able to take a survey open to that group)
##
##		  added option survey designer can select to specify whether users are allowed to change their answers in a given survey
##
##		  added code to assure that even if a board has a cache mod of some sort installed, the text that reads 'nonresponder' and 'total'
##		  will only appear if the survey specifies that nonresponders or totals should be shown.
##
##   2005-10-31	- Version 1.0.14a
##		  no changes...same exact mod, but changed the mod install script to dovetail with changes made to phpbb 2.0.18; 
##		  if you already have version 1.0.14 of this mod working on your board and you upgrade your board to phpbb 2.0.18 
##		  then you are already running version 1.0.14a of this mod and there are no changes you need to make
##
##   2005-10-08	- Version 1.0.14
##		  fixed errors that (a) prevented second fill-in survey button (the one next to the reply button) 
##		  from working and (b) prevented the option to omit responder names from working properly
##
##   2005-08-28	- Version 1.0.13
##		  added option to have survey close after ___ days (just like the option to have a poll close)
##
##   2005-07-30	- Version 1.0.12
##		  added ability of admin to retrieve another user's answers (rather than starting from scratch) when
##		  answering for another user;
##
##		  changed response cap lookup so that only users currently in one of the 
##		  groups taking the survey are counted against the caps (so if a user responds to a survey and then gets
##		  moved out of the groups allowed to take that survey his responses no longer count against the cap);
##
##		  added test to make sure that if someone opens a survey answer form before a response cap for a question
##		  has been hit and then another user answers a question so that the response cap for that question has 
##		  now been hit and the first user then tries to answer that question (a fairly rare occurance!), he will 
##		  be told that the cap has been hit and he should try again;
##
##		  made various other miscellaneous changes that did not change functionality (including changing 
##		  templates to assure xhtml compliance, changing sort by first answer code so that it uses code
##		  that works with mssql (the previous version worked right with mysql but not mssql),
##		  modifiying code to ensure consistent use of constants throughout and a re-write of survey.php
##		  to improve efficiency of code)
##
##   2005-07-15	- Version 1.0.11a
##		  fixed typo that caused the first nonresponder to be omitted when the survey lists nonresponders.
##
##   2005-07-10	- Version 1.0.11
##		  added option to average responses rather than totalling them (including ability to specify number of
##		  digits to round to when averaging);
##
##		  fixed error that would skip zero entries rather than adding them in totals
##
##		  changed lists of responders and nonresponders so that each
##		  appears as a link to his or her profile (so that it is easy to pm anyone on those lists);
##
##		  added option to have more than 8 questions (but note that having more than 8 questions will
##		  result in a page width for the topic that is beyond the width of the user's monitor; as a
##		  result the topic page will have a horizontal scroll bar);
##
##		  alphabetized the lines this mod adds to lang_main.php so that it is easier to find them;
##
##		  conformed survey explanation (in lang_main.php) and the readme.html file (i.e. the user's manual
##		  for the survey mod) to pick up changes made in this version
##
##   2005-06-13	- Version 1.0.10
##		  changed posting.php so that if a survey designer leaves out the survey caption but completes one or more questions,
##		  the survey will get stored
##
##		  added flexibility to include a subsilver fill-in survey or change survey answer button next to the reply button
##		  at the bottom of viewtopic so that it is less likely that users will try to answer the survey question by hitting 'reply'
##		  (leave out the changes to viewtopic_body.tpl if you don't want these buttons)
##
##		  added a new button in the survey results block that appears on the top of viewtopic for any ADMIN that allows the ADMIN
##		  to fill in the survey for any other user who can't figure it out; if you don't want this change, leave out the
##		  lines in survey_result_viewtopic.tpl that read:
##
##		  <!-- BEGIN switch_include_fill_out_for_other_user_button -->
##		    <tr>
##			<td align="center">{S_HIDDEN_FIELDS}<input type="submit" name="fill_out_for_other_user" value="{L_FILL_OUT_FOR_OTHER_USER}" class="mainoption" /></td>
##		    </tr>
##		  <!-- END switch_include_fill_out_for_other_user_button -->
##
##		  Changed text of $lang['If_selections'] in language/lang_english/lang_main.php to clarify that survey designer can start a drop down menu list of
##		  selections with a semicolon in order for the users to have the option not to answer anything to a drop down menu question; made small
##		  changer in $lang['Cap_response'].
##
##   2005-05-07	- Version 1.0.9
##		  added options to show nonresponders in a centered or left justified column or a centered or left justified comma separated list
##
##		  added option to specify (in pixels) a maximum height for the survey display box in viewtopic; if the survey is taller than that, it will
##		  automatically insert scroll bars.  Note that IE does not currently support the 'max-height' style element and for that reason if you specify
##		  a height that in fact is taller than the survey box needs, a survey box with some blank space will be seen (for example,
##		  if you specify the survey box cannot be more than 1000 pixels and the survey in fact is only 500 pixels, the box will take up 500
##		  pixels in firefox or mozilla but will show the enire 100 pixels with empty lines at the bottom when seen in IE.  For this reason, it's
##		  best to specify max heights that are smaller than the size the survey box takes up so that there never is any skipped lines.
##
##   2005-04-26	- Version 1.0.8
##		  Fixed problem that reulted in design survey form not being fully displayed in preview if there is not survey caption filled in.
##
##		  Changed language text describing sort options to be more self-explanatory
##
##   2005-04-24	- Version 1.0.7
##		  added option for survey designer to choose for answers to get single, double or triple spaced;
##
##		  added code so that topics with surveys in them get marked as '[ Survey ]' in viewforum (just like Polls get marked
##		  '[ Polls ]');
##
##		  Moved some text that appeared in a template to lang_eng so that people who run their board with languages other than
##		  English will be able to translate the text without going into that template;
##
##		  Changed the survey explanation text so that it correctly says you can ask up to eight questions;
##
##		  Added test in survey.php that checks to see if user has already got a response in a given survey
##		  (in order to assure that a user doesn't inadvertently submit his survey answers twice).
##
##   2005-04-04	- Version 1.0.6
##		  Preserves skipped lines in questions, answers and survey captions
##
##   2005-03-24	- Version 1.0.5
##		  Minor changes, mostly to protect against sql injection risk.  No changes in functionality
##
##   2005-03-19	- Version 1.0.4
##		  Added option to leave out the username column; changed max number of questions from 7 to 8;
##		  fixed behavior when survey is designed to be taken by 'all users'; changed the text that the person
##		  designing a survey sees when he is desinging the survey
##
##   2005-03-08	- Version 1.0.3
##		  Added protection against double submission of survey answers when user quickly clicks submit twice; fixed sort by first answer so that it
##		  looks only at the first answer and then alphabetizes; added reverse sort by first answer
##
##   2005-02-28	- Version 1.0.2
##		  In the design survey form, added option to sort the tabulated results by first answer with secondary sort by username.
##		  Also changed things so that anyone who is authorized to post a poll will be authorized to post a survey (but it's easy to change this
##		  back so that only admins are authorized to post surveys if you want).
##
##   2005-02-26	- Version 1.0.1
##		  initial version...still need to build in that previeiwng a post does not kill a new survey in that post, and
##		  still need to add code so that you can use the delete survey function and, if you delete a post with a survey in it,
##		  it will delete the survey and survey answer info tied to that post.
