<b><u>Surveys ... how the hell do I post them??</u></b>
<br />
<br />
<br />
This manual explains how to use the tabulated survey at topic head mod to post surveys.  You may find it helpful to print this out so that you can use it as a reference.  But note that most of this is self-explanatory, so if you're like me and you <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">HATE</span></span> directions feel free to experiment (don't worry, you won't hurt anything!).
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Step 1: open the design form, dummy</span></span>
<br />
Anyone who is authorized to post a poll can post a survey (if you want to tinker with rights to post surveys, see the author's notes in the mod).  So, if you're authorized to post a survey, go ahead and start a new post.
<br />

<br />
When you do that, you will see, right underneath the window where you usually type the post, a new link called "Click here to access or hide survey design box".  Go ahead and click it.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Step 2: Omigod, that's too complicated!</span></span>
<br />
OK, I admit it.  When you click that link a horribly complicated form opens up.  But it needs to be that complicated in order to give users the power to create very complicated surveys.  So get over it.

<br />

<br />
But the good news is this: if you read the text in the form line by line, it's actually pretty self-explanatory.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Step 3: What do I do in that top part?</span></span>
<br />
The top part of the form is where you give the basic information the survey needs in order to know how to display itself.
<br />

<br />
<ul><li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Survey Caption</span>: Here, you should fill in the title of the survey.  Example: "May 14 Parent Meeting: Please Complete Survey!"
<br />


<br />
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Select the groups that will be allowed to answer this survey</span>: Here, you need to check off whichever group or groups should be taking the survey.
<br />

<br />
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Order to show responders</span>: Here, decide which way the names of the responders should be listed.  When you do a survey asking people whether they will be attending an event, you may want to show users 'reverse alphabetical by text in the first answer' so that everyone who says 'yes' gets shown first and then everyone who says 'no' gets shown next.  Or, you may want to show 'alphabetical by username'.  Other possibilities include "in the order that users respond" and "alphabetical by text in first answer".  Suit yourself...feel free to experiment.
<br />

<br />
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">List the nonresponders?</span>: Here, decide whether you want the survey to include a list of the people in your selected groups that have not yet answered the survey (I refer to this as a 'Hall of Shame' ;) ).  This will allow you to see at a glance who has not responded and go after them personally if you need a response from everyone in the group.  If you choose to use this for a survey, you can also select which way the list will be displayed (I usually use 'yes, in column that is centered' but there are a variety of other choices, including 'yes, in column that is left justified', 'yes, in comma separated list that is left justified' and 'yes, in comma separated list that is cenetered').
<br />

<br />
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Max number of questions</span>: This controls how many questions show up on the survey design form.  The default is 8, which means that a new survey opens up with 8 question blanks.  You can leave this alone if your survey will have anywhere between 1 and 8 questions.  If you want your survey to have more than 8 questions, you can stick whatever number you want in this blank.  The change will take effect when you click preview...at that time you will see blanks for the max number of questions you have specified.  Note: if you ask more than around 8 questions in a survey, the questions will take up more room across the screen than a typical monitor can show and for that reason the screen will end up with a horizontal scrollbar for the topic that the survey appears in...<b><u>if you don't want a horizontal scrollbar, keep your questions to a reasonable number!</u></b>
<br />

<br />
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Lines to skip between answers</span>: This controls how many lines get skipped between each row of answers and the next row of answers.  Normally, you'll leave this at 1, but for surveys where an answer may take up many lines (like a survey that asks for addresses of the users), a single spaced display looks pretty messy and sometimes you'll decide to skip 2 or even 3 lines.
<br />

<br />
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Allow users to change their answers</span>: Here, decide whether you want to allow users to change their answers.  The default is yes.
<br />

<br />
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Number of days to run survey</span>: This allows you to limit the number of days that the survey will run (similar to the option phpbb2 gives you to limit the number of days that a poll will run).  If you leave this at 0 the survey will continue to run without limit.
<br />

<br />
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Max survey height</span>: This adds scrollbars to the list when there are too many users answering the survey.  I usually leave this blank so that all responses get shown, but if you have a very large group and don't want all the responses to appear at the top of the topic, you can set this to a number of pixels you feel comfortable with (e.g. 600 pixels) and only the first few responses will be shown (with others available via scrolling).
<br />

<br />
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Username width</span>: This forces the username list to be a certain width so that a username does not spill over onto two lines in a way that may look messy.  You can leave this blank and it will usually look fine, but if people's names spill over onto two lines (which generally only happens if you have lots and lots of questions in the survey so that it is cramped), you may want to set this to 175 or some other number that assures that names will stay on one line.  If you don't want any usernames shown, put a '-1' in this blank.</ul>
<br />


<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Step 4: I'm ready for my questions, Mr. DeMille.</span></span>
<br />
This is the guts of the survey...the questions.  You can ask anywhere from 1 to 8 questions in a single survey (the 8 question limit comes from the fact that showing 8 questions accross the screen looks crowded and showing more than 8 questions looks downright horrible).  The reason the form is so long is that it shows blanks for all 8 questions.  Of course if you are only asking one question ('Are you coming to XYZ event?') you will only fill out the blanks for the first question and leave the others blank.
<br />

<br />
Here's what to do on the questions part of the form:
<br />

<br />
<ul><li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Question</span>: Yup, you guessed it.  Just type your question here.  But think about how you want to phrase the question.  'Are you coming to XYZ event?' and 'I will be bringing the following fresh fruit to the event:' are both perfectly fine 'questions', even though one of those is really a statement rather than a question.
<br />

<br />

<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Question type</span>: This is probably the trickiest part of designing a survey.  You need to decide how the users are supposed to answer the question.
<br />

<br />
Do you want them to type in a textual answer?  If so, use a small or large text blank or a text box (the only difference among these is how much room the users will have to type their answers).  Text blanks or boxes are useful if your question is something like: 'I am bringing the following vegetables'.
<br />

<br />
But do not use this if there are only a handful of answers you are looking for.  If you want a simple 'yes' answer (I will be bringing Saturday breakfast for all) or a yes/no answer (I will be attending the moms dinner), or you want the person to choose among a number of options, or you want the person to tell you how many people he will be bringing to the event, a 'checkbox or radio buttons' or 'multiple choice checkboxes' or 'drop down menu' approach makes more sense.  Why?  Because if you use a text blank for a question like 'are you coming to the dinner', some people will answer yes and some will answer yup and some will say you betcha and at the end you will not have an organized list that will tell you at a moment's glance what the responses are.
<br />

<br />
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">If checkbox, radio buttons, multiple choice checkboxes or drop down menu, specify selections separated by semicolons</span>: If you select checkbox (regular or multiple choice), radio buttons or drop down menu as your question type, you must then fill in the blank right underneath to specify what options you want to give the users to select from.  If you just want a single checkbox for 'yes' you would type 'yes' in that blank.  If you want multiple choice checkboxes or radio buttons or a drop down menu with the options 1,2,3,4,5 or yes,no, you would type '1;2;3;4;5' or 'yes;no' in the blank.  You can give it any options you want so long as you separate them by semicolons.  And remember this: if you want people to have the ability <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">NOT</span></span> to make any selection among multiple choices, start the list of selections with an semicolon...that will show up first as an empty choice (just a blank) and if a user does not make another selection it will register as though the user didn't respond to the question at all (so that it won't mess up your totals if you are totalling responses).

<br />

<br />
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Should the responses be totalled?</span>: you've got a number of choices here that are mostly self-explanatory.
<br />

<br />
'<span style="text-decoration: underline">No</span>' means no (feminists will appreciate that).
<br />

<br />
'<span style="text-decoration: underline">Yes, by number of responses</span>' means whoever has answered that particular question in any way gets counted at the bottom.

<br />

<br />
'<span style="text-decoration: underline">Yes, by total of the numbers in the responses</span>' means that the numbers people answer for the question get totalled.  This is especially useful for a question like 'Number of adults coming to the weekend'.  You would have a drop down menu allowing people to specify for example 1;2;3;4;5;6 and if you total it this way the survey will keep a running tally of the number of adults coming.
<br />

<br />
'<span style="text-decoration: underline">Yes, by total responses matching specified text</span>' is the least intuitive but is quite useful.  If you select this choice, you need to fill in a particular word or phrase in the blank below that is captioned '<span style="text-decoration: underline">If totalling by responses matching text, specify that text</span>'; the survey will then keep a running tally of the number of people that gave the response you specified.  Example: Suppose your question is 'Are you coming to the dad's dinner' and you give people the option in a drop down menu to say 'yes' or 'no'.  You could use 'yes, by total responses matching specified text' and fill in 'yes' as the specified text and then the survey would keep a running tally of the people that said yes so that you would know how many people were coming.   Note: if you use this option, you should use radio buttons or a drop down rather than a text blank or box for the question so that users are constrained to answer in ways that will exactly match the text ('yes' rather than 'yup').
<br />

<br />
'<span style="text-decoration: underline">Yes, by average of the numbers in the responses</span>' means that numbers people answer for the question get averaged.  If you select this choice, you can specify the number of digits the average should be rounded to in the blank below that is captioned '<span style="text-decoration: underline">If averaging numbers in responses, specify the number of digits to round to</span>'.  If you don't specify the number of digits to round to, it will round to the nearest whole number.
<br />

<br />
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">If averaging numbers in responses, specify the number of digits to round to</span>: Fill in a number in this blank if you are averaging the numbers in the responses and want to specify the number of digits to round to.  If you do not specify any number, averages will be rounded to the nearest whole number.
<br />

<br />
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">If totalling, specify maximum total before users can no longer respond</span>: Fill in a number in this blank if you want to assure that only a certain number of people can respond to a question and no one else will be allowed to answer the question.  Example: suppose you only want 5 people to bring a meat course to a potluck dinner.  Your question could be a text blank like this: 'I am bringing the following meat course' and you could total the number of responders for that question, and then you could fill in '5' in the blank for 'if totalling, specify maximum total before users can no longer respond'.  In that case, after the 5th person answers with a meat course the question would no longer be one a later responder would be allowed to answer.  If you leave this blank, there will be no maximum.
<br />

<br />
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Question width</span>: This forces the column for a question to be a certain width.  I usually leave this blank and things usually look fine, but if you want to ensure that a given question column is wider or narrower than it would otherwise be, feel free to insert a number in this blank to specify a number of pixels for the column.</ul>
<br />

<br />
That's it. If you have a second question, just fill in the next set of question blanks.  Same for a third question, etc. (up to 8 questions in total).
<br />

<br />
And if you post something and it looks wrong, feel free to edit your post, click the show design survey link and edit the survey layout.  The only caution is that if someone has already answered the survey and you change the question, things may get a bit confused.
<br />


<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">But what should the post itself say?</span></span>: I dunno, up to you.  But as you can see from the surveys in there already, it is a good idea to make very clear (bold faced and underlined) that people should click the 'Fill out survey' button, answer the questions and click 'Submit'.  You do not want people answering the questions by replying to the post!
<br />

<br />
Final note: some surveys are very long and complicated and it would be nice to be able to just copy an old survey that looks close to what you want and just edit that, right?  Well, ask and ye shall receive:
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">I wrote another mod that gives people the power to 'clone' any post and survey</span></span>.  You can find that mod here: <a href="http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=291393" target="_blank">http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=291393</a>
<br />
Once you've installed that mod, if you find an old survey you want to start from, just click the new 'clone' button that appears at the top righthand side of the post (right next to the 'quote' button) and you will then be asked where you want the cloned post to go.  Make your selection and click 'clone' at the bottom and the old post with the survey will get cloned into a new post in the right place.  You can then click the 'Click here to access or hide survey design box' link and you will see the survey design form all filled out from the old post.  You can then tinker with things and post and you'll save a lot of time.
