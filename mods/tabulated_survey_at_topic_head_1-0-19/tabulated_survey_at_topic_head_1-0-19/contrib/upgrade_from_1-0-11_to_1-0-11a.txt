## MOD History:
##
##   2005-7-15	- Version 1.0.11a
##		  fixed typo that caused the first nonresponder to be omitted when the survey lists nonresponders.
##
##   2005-7-10	- Version 1.0.11
##		  added option to average responses rather than totalling them (including ability to specify number of 
##		  digits to round to when averaging);
##
##		  fixed error that would skip zero entries rather than adding them in totals
##
##		  changed lists of responders and nonresponders so that each 
##		  appears as a link to his or her profile (so that it is easy to pm anyone on those lists);
##
##		  added option to have more than 8 questions (but note that having more than 8 questions will
##		  result in a page width for the topic that is beyond the width of the user's monitor; as a
##		  result the topic page will have a horizontal scroll bar);
##
##		  alphabetized the lines this mod adds to lang_main.php so that it is easier to find them;
##
##		  conformed survey explanation (in lang_main.php) and the readme.html file (i.e. the user's manual
##		  for the survey mod) to pick up changes made in this version
##
##   2005-6-13	- Version 1.0.10
##		  changed posting.php so that if a survey designer leaves out the survey caption but completes one or more questions,
##		  the survey will get stored
##
##		  added flexibility to include a subsilver fill-in survey or change survey answer button next to the reply button
##		  at the bottom of viewtopic so that it is less likely that users will try to answer the survey question by hitting 'reply'
##		  (leave out the changes to viewtopic_body.tpl if you don't want these buttons)
##
##		  added a new button in the survey results block that appears on the top of viewtopic for any ADMIN that allows the ADMIN
##		  to fill in the survey for any other user who can't figure it out; if you don't want this change, leave out the 
##		  lines in survey_result_viewtopic.tpl that read:
##
##		  <!-- BEGIN switch_include_fill_out_for_other_user_button --> 
##		    <tr>
##			<td align="center">{S_HIDDEN_FIELDS}<input type="submit" name="fill_out_for_other_user" value="{L_FILL_OUT_FOR_OTHER_USER}" class="mainoption" /></td>
##		    </tr>
##		  <!-- END switch_include_fill_out_for_other_user_button -->
##
##		  Changed text of $lang['If_selections'] in language/lang_english/lang_main.php to clarify that survey designer can start a drop down menu list of
##		  selections with a semicolon in order for the users to have the option not to answer anything to a drop down menu question; made small 
##		  changer in $lang['Cap_response'].
##
##   2005-5-07	- Version 1.0.9
##		  added options to show nonresponders in a centered or left justified column or a centered or left justified comma separated list
##
##		  added option to specify (in pixels) a maximum height for the survey display box in viewtopic; if the survey is taller than that, it will
##		  automatically insert scroll bars.  Note that IE does not currently support the 'max-height' style element and for that reason if you specify
##		  a height that in fact is taller than the survey box needs, a survey box with some blank space will be seen (for example,
##		  if you specify the survey box cannot be more than 1000 pixels and the survey in fact is only 500 pixels, the box will take up 500
##		  pixels in firefox or mozilla but will show the enire 100 pixels with empty lines at the bottom when seen in IE.  For this reason, it's
##		  best to specify max heights that are smaller than the size the survey box takes up so that there never is any skipped lines.
##
##   2005-4-26	- Version 1.0.8
##		  Fixed problem that reulted in design survey form not being fully displayed in preview if there is not survey caption filled in.
##
##		  Changed language text describing sort options to be more self-explanatory		  
##
##   2005-4-24	- Version 1.0.7
##		  added option for survey designer to choose for answers to get single, double or triple spaced;
##
##		  added code so that topics with surveys in them get marked as '[ Survey ]' in viewforum (just like Polls get marked
##		  '[ Polls ]');
##
##		  Moved some text that appeared in a template to lang_eng so that people who run their board with languages other than
##		  English will be able to translate the text without going into that template;
##
##		  Changed the survey explanation text so that it correctly says you can ask up to eight questions;
##
##		  Added test in survey.php that checks to see if user has already got a response in a given survey
##		  (in order to assure that a user doesn't inadvertently submit his survey answers twice).
##
##   2005-4-04	- Version 1.0.6
##		  Preserves skipped lines in questions, answers and survey captions
##
##   2005-3-24	- Version 1.0.5
##		  Minor changes, mostly to protect against sql injection risk.  No changes in functionality
##
##   2005-3-19	- Version 1.0.4
##		  Added option to leave out the username column; changed max number of questions from 7 to 8;  
##		  fixed behavior when survey is designed to be taken by 'all users'; changed the text that the person
##		  designing a survey sees when he is desinging the survey
##
##   2005-3-08	- Version 1.0.3
##		  Added protection against double submission of survey answers when user quickly clicks submit twice; fixed sort by first answer so that it 
##		  looks only at the first answer and then alphabetizes; added reverse sort by first answer
##
##   2005-2-28	- Version 1.0.2
##		  In the design survey form, added option to sort the tabulated results by first answer with secondary sort by username. 
##		  Also changed things so that anyone who is authorized to post a poll will be authorized to post a survey (but it's easy to change this 
##		  back so that only admins are authorized to post surveys if you want).
##
##   2005-2-26	- Version 1.0.1
##		  initial version...still need to build in that previeiwng a post does not kill a new survey in that post, and
##		  still need to add code so that you can use the delete survey function and, if you delete a post with a survey in it, 
##		  it will delete the survey and survey answer info tied to that post.
