## Author Notes:
##
##   Before I dive into the FAQ, I should mention that this MOD is disabled by default.  To 
##   enable it, you will first have to successfully scan an IP address for proxies, via the
##   ACP.  Once this is done, you can enable the MOD by selecting the appropriate checkbox.
##
##   Now on to the FAQ.  The questions posed are questions that people have actually asked.
##   Some questions have, however, been slightly edited from the original, to make them
##   stand better on their own, to make them convey the same intent without the use of
##   bbcode, etc.
##
##   Q: onigumo asks "How likely is it that someone *might* happen to have open proxy
##      enabled by default if he or she is using DSL?"
##
##   A: Not likely at all.  The problem with open proxies is that they allow anyone to
##      use your network resources.  ISPs don't want this because they only want paying
##      custmers to have access to their resources and because they don't want to be held
##      liable for that which non-paying customers do.
##
##      Of course, despite the desires of ISPs, some legitimate users do have open proxy
##      servers running on their machines.  In this case, viruses are most likely to blame.
##      I say that because the chief goal of today's viruses are to create so-called
##      "zombie computers" - computers through which spam can be sent and IP-based filters
##      can be evaded.
##
##      However, even if that isn't the reason why they have an open proxy server running on
##      their machine, it should be sufficient reason for you to deny their registration
##      attempts for reasons already mentioned.
##
##   Q: tomcavboy3 asks "This mod will not work if you use them free proxy surf websites,
##      such as http://proxy.guardster.com/ ?"
##
##   A: No - this MOD can only detect open HTTP proxies.  In fact, whether or not these
##      "proxy surf" websites even qualify as proxies is up for debate.  Do a Google search
##      for "proxy list".  The hits that Google returns aren't "proxy surf" websites - they're
##      lists of open HTTP proxies.  Do a Google search for "proxy".  The hits that are returned
##      are again for HTTP proxies - be they for the software used to operate one or lists of
##      them.  Basically, when most people refer to a proxy, they aren't refering to a "proxy
##      surf" website - they're refering to HTTP proxies.  So no - this MOD won't detect "open
##      proxy" websites.
##
##      Besides, just because someone labels something as an open proxy doesn't mean it actually
##      is.
##
##   Q: Lots of people ask "Why doesn't this MOD work?"
##
##   A: Did you enable the MOD in the ACP?  It's disabled by default and cannot be enabled until
##      you have successfully scanned atleast one IP address.  If it still doesn't work,
##      suggestions are provided in the Debug Information panel.  If none of these work, you can
##      ask *me* for help.
##
##      I stress the *me* part because if there's a genuine problem with this MOD, it's going to
##      be *me* who has to fix it.
##
##   Q: class101 asks "Do you really think it's decent to lose new members due to a hack bug ?"
##
##   A: Consider what happens when you install Ptirhiik's Categories Hierarchy MOD.  If there's
##      a critical bug, the ENTIRE BOARD will be disabled.  In this MOD, ONLY registration will
##      be disabled.
##
##      I used to think the latter would be preferable to the former.  I was wrong.  Board
##      Administrators notice a board being disabled almost immediatly.  It may be weeks or
##      months, however, before they notice that registration has been disabled.  By the time
##      they do, they're pissed.  They don't care whether the fault was their own or not, and
##      they don't care whether or not the problem can be fixed.  All they want is vengance -
##      all they want is someone or something to blame.  So they blame me and this MOD.
##
##      So to answer the original question - no.  I don't, any longer, think its "decent".
##      That's why the MOD is now disabled by default.
##
##      As for these supposed "hack bugs" - take a look at the additions to lang_admin.php.
##      Take a look at the suggestions.  Most of these supposed "bugs" are things that I
##      can do nothing about, save for what I've already done.
##
##      Besides, how do you think that list of suggestions was compiled, anyway?  From "bug"
##      reports - reports on things that aren't really "bugs" in my MOD to begin with.
##
##   Anyway, that's the FAQ.  Additional information on what all can be done with this MOD can
##   be found here:

## MOD History:
##
##   2005-10-21 - Version 2.2.1
##      - fixed a bug preventing the MOD from being disabled (thanks, players_filter!)
##      - $start_conditions no longer needs to be defined.
##      - proxy/contrib/install.txt asked users to copy a non-existant file (thanks,
##        players_filter!)
##      - list($this->status, $this->port) has been replaced by something a little less
##        ambigious (thanks, players_filter!)
##      - connect.php now reports SQL errors.
##      - The Debug Panel in the ACP is now open, by default, if a Connection Timeout
##        error occured.
##      - IP addresses whose tests weren't conclusive are now deleted every time a test
##        is conducted.
##      - The MOD is now disabled by default.  To enable it, you will first need to conduct
##        a successful test of an IP address via the ACP.
##      - replaced stream_set_timeout and stream_set_blocking calls in connect.php with calls to
##        socket_set_timeout and socket_set_blocking (the latter work on PHP < 4.3.0, whereas the
##        former don't)
##      - added some more conditions to connect.php under which proxies are not scanned for.
##      - renamed the status column of the phpbb_proxies table to behavior (status is a reserved word).
##        those wishing to upgrade will need to do the following:
##        ALTER TABLE phpbb_proxies CHANGE status behavior tinyint(2);
##   2005-09-06 - Version 2.2.0
##      - created a proxy class for easier maintenance / usage / etc.
##      - replaced .2F% with .2f% (the former didn't work on PHP versions < 4.3.10 and < 5.0.3)
##      - used gethostbynamel instead of gethostbyname in connect.php.  this is kinda
##        necessary for round robin dns's (thanks, gEEk!)
##      - cached data is reset when the ports are changed.  for a more detailed explanation
##        as to why this is done, see the comments in admin_proxy.php
##      - the "Click Here to return to the previous page" now uses the javascript history
##        function instead of HTTP_GET_REFERER.
##      - added $lang['proxy_sort'] to lang_admin.php
##      - the Debug screen in the ACP can now be "closed" or "expanded".
##      - when connection timeout errors occur, suggestions are now given in the afore mentioned
##        Debug screen (these suggestions are based on problems I've helped others fix; if I get
##        too many complaints about people not being able to register when the solution to their
##        was presented in the ACP, I'll make it so the MOD can only be enabled *after* you've
##        tested it via the ACP atleast once)
##      - if using this MOD to block something other than registration attempts (be it login
##        attempts or whatever), the "Registration attempt blocked" message can now be changed
##        via the function call.  This also allows for multiple "blocked" messages.
##      - added an Extended Configurator add-on.  With it, you can add DNSBL checks to the proxy
##        checker in the ACP and you can change, via the ACP, the link that IP addresses point to
##        in the proxy lists.
##   2005-07-09 - Version 2.0.0
##      - complete rewrite
