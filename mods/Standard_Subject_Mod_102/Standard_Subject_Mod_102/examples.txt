		o	Film Review Site

Supposing you have a film review site, and you have users post a review of a movie on your site by creating a new topic in your forum. Now, let us say that one of these particulars films was True Lies, and the topic ID was 100.

Using another program such as phpBBFetchAll, you syndicate this information to your site index. Now, you want users to be able to post a reply to the topic, so you provide a link to it. Using the Standard Subject MOD, you can make the subject field be filled automatically, with relevant text, such as "Re: True Lies" or "Review for True Lies".

In your PHP code, you have the name of the particular film held under the $film_title variable. Now at the moment, all you are doing is linking to a reply page, possibly with the following HTML, embedded somewhere within the PHP script: 

	echo "<a href='posting.php?mode=reply&t=100'>Review the film $film_title</a>";

With this MOD, all you have to do, is change that HTML to the code below, to have the subject field filled automatically.

	echo "<a href='posting.php?mode=reply&t=7&subject=Review for the film $film_title'>Review the film $film_title</a>";

Now when the user replies, the subject field will already be filled with "Review for the film True Lies".

Of course, you as the admin can set "subject=" to whatever you would like. Test it out, and see which text works best for you and your site. For a film review site, here are some suggestions (again, assuming $film_title is the film title).

	-	Review for $film_title
	- 	Review for the film $film_title
	-	Re: $film_title
	-	$film_title review
