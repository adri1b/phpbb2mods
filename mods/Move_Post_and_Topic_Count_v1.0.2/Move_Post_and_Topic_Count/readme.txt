Move Post and Topic Counts MOD

This is a pretty simple mod to install, but it's also a pretty good fix for reducing forum space on the index.


There are 2, count them 2, install files.

ONE is for installing this MOD for forums that have the
    Hierarchy Forums MOD installed already.

FOR ANY OTHER FORUMS, use the normal install file.

Same goes for the Addition folder. (2) install files.


ONE for normal
OTHER for Hierarchy Forums 

:D Easy enough.

Just change the style to 'AVM' with the style selector at
the top.)
